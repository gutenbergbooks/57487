</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_1">LEGERDEMAIN, OR SLEIGHT-OF-HAND,</h2>
</div>

<p>Is an art whereby a person seems to work wonderful, incredible,
and almost impossible feats. There is no supernatural
or infernal agency in the case; for every
trick is performed by nimbleness, agility, and effrontery.</p>

<h3 id="sec_0"><i>The Operator.</i></h3>

<p>The Operator, or Conjurer, should be a person of bold
and undaunted resolution, so as to set a good face upon
the matter, in case of the occurrence of any mistake
whereby a discovery of the nature of the trick in hand
may take place by one of the spectators.</p>

<p>He ought to have a great variety of strange terms and
high-sounding words at command, so as to grace his actions,
amaze the beholders, and draw their attention
from the more minute operations.</p>

<p>He ought likewise to use such gestures of body as
may help to draw off the attention of the spectators
from a strict scrutiny of his actions.</p>

<p>In showing feats and juggling with cards, the principal
point consists in the shuffling them nimbly, and always
keeping one card either at the bottom or in some
known place of the pack, four or five cards from it;
hereby you will seem to work wonders, for it will be
easy for you to see one card, which, though you be perceived
to do it, will not be suspected, if you shuffle them
well afterwards; and this caution I must give you, that,
in reserving the bottom card, you must always, whilst
you shuffle, keep it a little before or a little behind all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
the cards lying underneath it, bestowing it either a little
beyond its fellows before, right over the fore-finger, or
else behind the rest, so as the little finger of the left
hand may meet with it, which is the easier, readier, and
better way. In the beginning of your shuffling, shuffle as
thick as you can, and, in the end, throw upon the pack
the nether card, with so many more, at the least, as you
would have preserved for any purpose, a little before or
a little behind the rest, provided always that your fore-finger
(if the pack lie behind) creep up to meet with the
bottom card; and, when you feel it, you may then hold
it until you have shuffled over the cards again, still
leaving your <em>kept card</em> below. Being perfect herein, you
may do almost what you like with cards by this means:
what pack soever you use, though it consist of eight,
twelve, or twenty cards, you may keep them still together
unsevered, next to the card, and yet shuffle them
often, to satisfy the admiring beholders. As for example,
and for brevity sake, to show divers feats under
<span class="locked">one:—</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_1"><i>To deliver Four Aces, and to convert them into
Knaves.</i></h3>

<p>Make a pack of these eight cards, viz. four knaves
and four aces; and, although the eight cards must be
immediately together, yet must each knave and ace be
evenly set together, and the same eight cards must lie
also in the lowest place of the pack; then shuffle them
so always, at the second shuffling; so that, at the end of
shuffling the said pack, one ace may lie undermost, or so
as you may know where it goeth and lieth always: I
say, let your aforesaid pack, with three or four cards
more, lie inseparable together, immediately upon and
with that ace. Then using some speech or other device,
and putting your hands, with the cards, to the edge
of the table, to hide the action, let out, privately, a piece
of the second card, which is one of the knaves, holding
forth the pack in both your hands, and showing to the
standers-by the nether card, which is the ace, or kept
card, covering also the head or piece of the knave,
which is the next card, and, with your fore-finger, draw
out the same knave, laying it down on the table; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
shuffle them again, keeping your pack whole, and so
have your two aces lying together at the bottom. And,
to reform that disordered card, and also to grace and
countenance that action, take off the uppermost card of
the bunch, and thrust it into the midst of the cards, and
then take away the nethermost card, which is one of
your said aces, and bestow it likewise; then you may
begin as before, showing another ace, and instead thereof
lay down another knave, and so forth, until, instead
of four aces, you have laid down four knaves; the
spectators, all this while, thinking that four aces lie on
the table, are greatly amused, and will wonder at the
transformation. You must be well practised in shuffling
the pack, lest you overshoot yourself.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_2">TRICKS WITH CARDS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_2"><i>Method of making the Pass.</i></h3>

<p>This art consists in bringing a certain number of cards
from the bottom of the pack to the top. I shall explain
the method of doing it, before proceeding further,
as many of the following recreations depend on the dexterous
performance of this manœuvre. Hold the pack of
cards in your right hand, so that the palm of your hand
may be under the cards. Place the thumb of that hand
on one side of the pack, the first, second, and third fingers
on the other side, and your little finger between
those cards that are to be brought to the top, and the
rest of the pack. Then place your left hand over the
cards, in such a manner that the thumb may be at C,
and the fingers at B, according to the following
<span class="locked">figures:—</span></p>

<div id="ip_3" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 10.375em;">
  <img src="images/i_009.jpg" width="166" height="150" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
The hands and the two parts of the cards being thus
disposed, you draw off the lower cards, confined by the
little finger and the other parts of the right hand, and
place them, with an imperceptible motion, on the top of
the pack. It is necessary, before you attempt any of the
recreations that depend on making the pass, that you
can perform it so dexterously that the eye cannot distinguish
the motion of your hand; otherwise, instead of deceiving
others, you will expose yourself. It is also proper
that the cards make no noise, as that will occasion
suspicion. This dexterity is not to be attained without
some practice. It is sometimes usual to prepare a pack
of cards, by inserting one or more that are a small matter
longer or wider than the rest; and that preparation will
be necessary in some of the following recreations.</p>

<h3 id="sec_3"><i>The Card of Divination.</i></h3>

<p>Have a pack in which there is a longer card than the
rest; open the pack at that part where the long card is,
and present the pack to a person in such a manner that
he will naturally draw that card. He is then to put it
into any part of the pack, and shuffle the cards. You
take the pack and offer the same card in like manner to
a second or third person; observing, however, that they
do not stand near enough to observe the card each other
draws. You then draw several cards yourself, among
which is the long card; and ask each of the parties if
his card be among those cards, and he will naturally
say yes, as they have all drawn the same card. You
then shuffle all the cards together, and, cutting them at
the long card, you hold it before the first person, so
that the others may not see it, and tell him that is his
card. You then put it again in the pack, and, shuffling
them a second time, you cut again at the same card, and
hold it in like manner to the second person; and so of
the rest.</p>

<p>If the first person should not draw the long card, each
of the parties must draw different cards; when, cutting
the pack at the long card, you put those they have drawn
over it, and, seeming to shuffle the cards indiscriminately,
you cut them again at the long card, and show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
one of them his card. You then shuffle and cut again,
in the same manner, and show another person his card,
and so on; remembering that the card drawn by the
last person is the first next the long card; and so of the
others.</p>

<h3 id="sec_3a"><i>Another Way.</i></h3>

<p>This recreation may be performed without the long
card, in the following manner: let a person draw any
card whatever, and replace it in the pack; you then
make the pass, and bring that card to the top of the pack,
and shuffle them without losing sight of that card. You
then offer that card to a second person, that he may
draw it, and put it in the middle of the pack. You make
the pass, and shuffle the cards a second time, in the
same manner, and offer the card to a third person; and
so again to a fourth or fifth.</p>

<h3 id="sec_4"><i>The Four Confederate Cards.</i></h3>

<p>You let a person draw any four cards from the pack,
and tell him to think of one of them. When he returns
you the four cards, you dexterously place two of them
under the pack, and two on the top. Under those at the
bottom you place four cards of any sort, and then, taking
eight or ten from the bottom cards, you spread them on
the table, and ask the person if the card he fixed on be
among them. If he say no, you are sure it is one of the
two cards on the top. You then pass those two cards
to the bottom, and, drawing off the lowest of them, you
ask if that is not his card. If he again say no, you take
that card up, and bid him draw his card from the bottom
of the pack. If the person says his card is among those
you first drew from the bottom, you must dexterously
take up the four cards that you put under them, and,
placing those on the top, let the other two be the bottom
cards of the pack, which you are to draw in the manner
before described.</p>

<h3 id="sec_5"><i>The Fifteen Thousand Livres.</i></h3>

<p>You must be prepared with two cards like the <span class="locked">following:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<div id="ip_6" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 4.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_012.jpg" width="78" height="112" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">and with a common ace and five of diamonds. The five
of diamonds, and the two prepared cards, are to be disposed
<span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<div id="ip_6b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 14.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_012b.jpg" width="233" height="141" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">and, holding them in your hand, you say,—“A certain
Frenchman left fifteen thousand livres, which are represented
by these three cards, to his three sons; the two
youngest agreed to leave their 5000, each of them, in the
hands of the elder, that he might improve it.” While
you are telling this story, you lay the five on the table,
and put the ace in its place, and at the same time artfully
change the position of the other two cards, that
the three cards may appear as in the following <span class="locked">figure:—</span></p>

<div id="ip_6c" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 13.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_012c.jpg" width="222" height="120" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p class="in0">You then resume your discourse. “The eldest brother,
instead of improving the money, lost it all by gaming,
except three thousand livres, as you here see.” You
then lay the ace on the table, and, taking up the five,
continue your story. “The eldest, sorry for having lost
the money, went to the East Indies with these 3000, and
brought back 15,000.” You then show the cards in the
same position as at first. To render this deception
agreeable, it must be performed with dexterity, and
should not be repeated, but the cards immediately put
in the pocket; and you should have five common cards
in your pocket, ready to show, if any one should desire
to see them. Another recreation of this sort may be
performed with fives and threes, as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<div id="ip_7" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="379" height="300" alt="" /></div>

<h3 id="sec_6"><i>The Magic Ring.</i></h3>

<p>Make a ring large enough to go on the second or
third finger, in which let there be set a large transparent
stone, to the bottom of which must be fixed a small
piece of black silk, that may be either drawn aside or
expanded by turning the stone round. Under the silk
is to be the figure of a small card. Then make a person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
draw the same sort of card as that at the bottom of the
ring, and tell him to burn it in the candle. Having first
shown him the ring, you take part of the burnt card,
and, reducing it to powder, you rub the stone with it;
and, at the same time, turn it artfully round, so that the
small card at bottom may come in view.</p>

<h3 id="sec_7"><i>The Card in the Mirror.</i></h3>

<p>Provide a mirror, either round, like the following
figure,</p>

<div id="ip_8" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 15.4375em;">
  <img src="images/i_014.jpg" width="247" height="258" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">or oval; the frame of which must be at least as wide as a
card. The glass in the centre must be made to move in
the two grooves, C D and E F; and so much of the silvering
must be scraped off as is equal to the size of a
common card. Observe that the glass be likewise wider
than the width of the card. Then paste over the part
where the quicksilver is rubbed off a piece of pasteboard,
on which affix a card that exactly fits the space,
which must at first be placed behind the frame. This
mirror must be placed against a partition, through
which are to go two strings, by which an assistant in the
adjoining room can easily move the glass in the grooves,
and consequently make the card appear or disappear at
pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Matters being thus prepared, you contrive to make a
person draw the same sort of card with that fixed to the
mirror, and place it in the middle of the pack: you then
make the pass, and bring it to the bottom: you then direct
the person to look for his card in the mirror, when
the confederate, behind the partition, is to draw it slowly
forward, and it will appear as if placed between the
glass and the quicksilver. While the glass is being drawn
forward, you slide off the card from the bottom of the
pack, and convey it away. The card fixed to the mirror
may easily be changed each time the experiment is performed.
This recreation may also be made with a print
that has a glass before it, and a frame of sufficient
width, by making a slit in the frame, through which the
card is to pass; but the effect will not be so striking as
in the mirror.</p>

<h3 id="sec_8"><i>The Marvellous Vase.</i></h3>

<p>Place a vase of wood or pasteboard, like the <span class="locked">following:—</span></p>

<p>A B, on a bracket L, to the partition M.</p>

<div id="ip_9" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 12em;">
  <img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="192" height="315" alt="" /></div>

<p>Let the inside of this vase be divided into five parts,
<i>c, d, e, f, g</i>; and let the divisions <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> be wide enough
to admit a pack of cards, and those of <i>e, f, g</i>, one card<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
only. Fix a thread of silk at the point H, the end of which,
passing down the division <i>d</i>, and over the pulley I, runs
along the bracket L, and goes out behind the partition
M. Take three cards from a piquet pack, and place one
of them in each of the divisions, <i>e, f, g</i>, making the silk
thread or line go under each of them. In the division <i>c</i>
put the pack of cards, from which you have taken the
three cards that are in the other divisions. Then take
another pack of cards, at the bottom of which are to be
three cards of the same sort with those in the three
small divisions, and, making the pass, bring them to the
middle of the pack, and let them be drawn by three
different persons. Then give them all the cards to shuffle,
after which place the pack in the division <i>d</i>, and tell the
parties they shall see the three cards they drew come,
at their command, separately out of the vase. An assistant
behind the partition then drawing the line with a
gentle and equal motion, the three cards will gradually
rise out of the vase. Then take the cards out of the
division <i>c</i>, and show that those three cards are gone from
the pack. The vase must be placed so high that the
inside cannot be seen by the company. You may perform
this recreation also without an assistant, by fixing
a weight to the end of the silk line, which is to be placed
on a support, and let down at pleasure, by means of a
spring in the partition.</p>

<h3 id="sec_9"><i>The Nerve Trick.</i></h3>

<p>Having previously looked at a card, bid the person
draw one, taking care to show him that which you know;
when he has it, let him put it at the bottom; let him
shuffle the cards, then look at them again, and, finding
the card, place it at the bottom; then cut them in half;
give the party that half which contains his chosen card
at the bottom, to hold between his finger and thumb, just
at the corner; bid him pinch them as tight as he can;
then striking them pretty sharply, they will all fall to the
ground, except the bottom one, which is the card he has
chosen. This is a very curious trick, and, if cleanly done,
is really astonishing. It may be accounted for from the
nature of the nerves, which are always more retentive
when any thing is attempted to be taken, either by force
or surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_10"><i>To make the Constable catch the Knave.</i></h3>

<p>Take a pack of cards, and look out the four knaves;
lay one of them privately on the top of the pack, and
the other three down upon the table, saying, “<i>Here, you
see, are three knaves got together, about no good you may
be sure</i>;” then lay down a king beside them, saying,
“But here comes the constable and catches them together:
‘<i>Oh, says he, have I caught you? Well, the next time
I catch you together, I’ll punish you severely for all your
rogueries.</i>’ ‘<i>Oh</i>,’ but say they, ‘<i>you shan’t catch us
again together in haste</i>;’ so they conclude to run three
several ways. ‘<i>Well, I’ll go here</i>,’ says one (so take
one of the knaves, and put him at the top of the pack).
‘<i>And I’ll go here</i>,’ says another (so put him at the
bottom). ‘<i>Then I’ll go here</i>,’ says a third (so put him
in the middle). ‘<i>Nay</i>,’ says the constable, ‘<i>if you
run, I’ll make sure of one; so I’ll follow the first</i>.’” Then
take the king and put him at the top, and let any one cut
the cards asunder two or three times; then deal, cut the
cards one by one, and you shall find three together, and
the constable with them.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This feat would be best done with a pack of
cards that has two knaves of that sort which you put in
the middle.</p>

<h3 id="sec_11"><i>To change a Card into a King or Queen.</i></h3>

<p>To do this, you must have the picture in your sleeve,
and, by a swift sleight, return the card, and fetch out the
picture with a back bending. The manner of doing this
is better learnt by frequent trials than can be taught by
many words. But, if you would do this feat, and yet
hold your hand straight and unmoved, then you must
peel off the spots or figure of a card, as thin as you can,
and just fasten it on the picture with something that will
make it stick a little; then, having shown the spots or
figure of the card, you may draw it off, and roll it up
with your thumb into a very narrow compass, holding it
undiscovered, between the inside of the thumb and the
ball of your fore-finger; and so produce the picture, to
the admiration of the beholders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_12"><i>To tell a Person what Card he took Notice of.</i></h3>

<p>Take any number of cards, as ten, twelve, and then,
holding them with their backs towards you, open four
or five of the uppermost, and, as you hold them out
to view, let any one note a card, and tell you whether it
be the first, second, or third from the top; but you must
privately know the whole number of those cards you
took. Now shut up your cards in your hands, and take
the rest of the pack, which place upon them; then
knock their ends and sides upon the table; so it will
seem impossible to find the noted card, yet it may
easily be done, thus: subtract the number of cards you
held in your hand from fifty-two, the whole number in
the pack, and to the remainder add the number of the
noted card; so the same shall be the number of the noted
card from the top; therefore take off the cards one by
one, smelling to them till you come to the noted card.</p>

<h3 id="sec_13"><i>To tell what Card is at the Bottom, when the Pack
is shuffled.</i></h3>

<p>When you have seen a card privately, or as though
you marked it not, lay the same undermost, and shuffle
the cards till your card be again at the bottom. Then
show the same to the bystanders, bidding them remember
it. Now shuffle the cards, or let any other shuffle them,
for you know the card already, and therefore may, at
any time, tell them what card they saw, which, nevertheless,
must be done with caution or show of difficulty.</p>

<h3 id="sec_14"><i>Another Way, not having seen the Cards.</i></h3>

<p>If you can see no card, or be suspected to have seen
that which you mean to show, then let a bystander shuffle,
and afterwards take the cards into your own hands,
and, having shown them, and not seen the bottom card,
shuffle again, and keep the same cards as before you are
taught; and either make shift then to see it when their
suspicion is past, which may be done by letting some
cards fall, or else lay down all the cards in heaps, remembering
where you laid the bottom card; then see
how many cards lie in some one heap, and lay the flap
where your bottom card is upon that heap, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
other heaps upon the same; and so, if there were five
cards in the heap whereon you laid your card, then the
same must be the sixth card, which now you must throw
out, or look upon with suspicion, and tell them the card
they saw.</p>

<h3 id="sec_15"><i>To tell, without Confederacy, what Card one thinks of.</i></h3>

<p>Lay three cards at a distance, and bid a bystander be
true, and not waver, but think on one of the three, and
by his eye you shall assuredly perceive which he thinks
on; and you shall do the like if you cast down a whole
pack of cards with the faces upwards, whereof there
will be few, or none plainly perceived, and they also
court cards; but as you cast them down suddenly, so
must you take them up presently, marking both his eyes
and the card whereon he looks.</p>

<h3 id="sec_16"><i>To make a Card jump out of the Pack, and run on
the Table.</i></h3>

<p>Take a pack of cards, and let any one draw a card
that he likes best, and afterwards take and put it into
the pack, but so as you know where to find it at pleasure.
Then take a piece of wax, and put it under the
thumb-nail of your right hand, and thus fasten a hair
to your thumb, and the other end of the hair to the card.
Now spread the pack of cards open upon the table, and,
making use of any technical words or charms, seem
to make it jump on the table.</p>

<h3 id="sec_17"><i>To tell a Card, and to convey the Same into a Nut,
or Cherry-Stone.</i></h3>

<p>Take a nut or cherry-stone, and burn a hole through
the side of the top of the shell, and also through the kernel,
if you will, with a hot bodkin, or bore it with an
awl, and with a needle pull out the kernel, so as the
same may be as wide as the hole of the shell; then write
the name of the card on a piece of fine paper, and roll
it up hard. Put it into the nut or cherry-stone, and stop
the hole up with a little wax, and rub the same over with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
a little dust, and it will not be perceived; then let some
bystander draw a card, saying, “<i>It is no matter what
card you draw</i>,” and, if your hands so serve you to use
the cards well, you shall proffer him, and he shall receive,
the same card that you have rolled the name of up
in the nut. Now take another nut and fill it up with
ink, and stop the hole up with wax, and then give that
nut which is filled with ink to some boy to crack, and,
when he finds the ink come out of his mouth, it will
cause great laughter. Many other feats of this kind may
be done, so as to keep the company in good humour.</p>

<h3 id="sec_18"><i>To let Twenty Gentlemen draw Twenty Cards, and
to make one Card every Man’s Card.</i></h3>

<p>Take a pack of cards and let any gentleman draw
one; then let him put it into the pack again, but be sure
where to find it again at pleasure; then shuffle the cards
again, and let another gentleman draw a card; but be
sure that you let him draw no other than the same card
as the other drew, and so do for ten or twelve, or as many
cards as you think fit; when you have so done, let another
gentleman draw another card, but not the same,
and put that card into the pack where you have kept the
other one, and shuffle them till you have brought both
the cards together; then showing the last card to the
company, the other will be considered a more wonderful
achievement.</p>

<h3 id="sec_19"><i>To transform the Four Kings into Aces, and afterwards
to render them all Blank Cards.</i></h3>

<p>A clever juggler will take four kings in his hand, and
apparently show them to the bystanders, and then, after
some words and charms, he will throw them down upon the
table, taking one of the kings away, and adding but one
other card; then taking them up again, and blowing upon
them, he will show you them transformed into blank cards,
white on both sides; then throwing them down as before,
with their faces downwards, he will take them up again,
and, blowing upon them, will show you four aces.</p>

<p>This trick is not inferior to any that is performed with
cards, and yet is very pretty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
To perform it, you must have cards made for the purpose,
<em>half cards</em> we may call them; that is, one half
kings and the other half aces; so, laying the aces one
over the other, nothing but the king will be seen, and
then, turning the kings downwards, the four aces will be
seen; but you must have two whole cards, one a king to
cover one of the aces, or else it will be perceived, and
the other an ace to lay over the kings, when you mean to
show the aces; then, when you would make them all
blank, lay the cards a little lower, and hide the aces,
and they will appear all white. The like you may make
of four knaves, putting upon them the four fives; and so
of the other cards.</p>

<h3 id="sec_20"><i>To name all the Cards in the Pack, and yet never
see them.</i></h3>

<p>To do this, you must privately drop a little water or
beer, about the size of a crown-piece, upon the table
before which you sit; then rest your elbows upon
the table, so that the cuffs of your sleeves may meet, and
your hands stick up to the brims of your hat; in this
posture your arms will hide the drop of water from the
company; then let any one take the cards and shuffle
them, and put them into your hands; also let him set a
candle before you, for this trick is best done by candlelight.
Then holding the cards in your left hand, above
the brim of your hat, close up to your head, so that the
light of the candle may shine upon the cards, and holding
your head down, so in the drop of water, like a
looking-glass, you shall see the shadow of all the cards
before you. Now draw the finger of your right hand
along upon the card, as if you were feeling it, and then
lay it down. Thus you may lay down all the cards in
the pack, one by one, naming them before you lay them
down, which will seem very strange to the beholders,
who will think that you have <em>felt them</em> out.</p>

<h3 id="sec_21"><i>To show any one what Card he takes Notice of.</i></h3>

<p>Let any one take a card out of the pack, and note it;
then take part of the pack in your hand, and lay the rest
down upon the table, bidding him lay his noted card<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
upon them; then, turning your back towards the company,
make as though you were looking over the cards
in your hand, and put any card at the fore-side; and,
whilst your are doing this privately, wait till the cards are
laid out in heaps, to find what the bottom cards are. Bid
any one take four cards of the same number, viz. four aces,
four deuces, four trèys, and any other number not exceeding
ten (for he must not take court cards), and lay
them out; then take the remaining cards, if any such
there be, and divide their number by four, and the
quotient shall be the number of spots of the four cards;
if twelve cards remain, then on each bottom card are
trèys, and, if there be no remaining cards, then the four
bottom cards are aces.</p>

<h3 id="sec_22"><i>To tell the Number of Spots on the Bottom Cards,
laid down in several Heaps.</i></h3>

<p>Bid any one take the whole pack of cards in his hand,
and, having shuffled them, let him take off the upper
card, and, having taken notice of it, let him lay it down
upon the table, with its face downwards, and upon it
let him lay so many cards as will make up the number of
spots on the noted card, <i>e. g.</i> twelve. If the card which
the person first took notice of was a king, queen, knave,
or a single ten, bid him lay down that card with its face
downwards, calling it ten; upon that card let him lay another,
calling it eleven, and upon that another, calling it
twelve; then bid him take off the next uppermost card,
saying, “<i>What is it?</i>” Suppose it were a nine, laying it
down on another part of the table, and calling it nine,
upon it let him lay another, calling it ten; upon it another,
calling it eleven; and upon it another, calling it
twelve; then let him look on the next uppermost card:
and so let him proceed to lay them out in a heap, in all
respects as before, till he has laid out the whole pack;
but, if there be any cards at the last (I mean if there be
not enough to make up the last noted card twelve), bid
him give them to you; then, to tell him the number of all
the spots contained in all the bottom cards of the heaps,
do thus:—from the number of heaps subtract four, and
multiply the remainder by fifteen, and to the product
add the number of those remaining cards which he gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
you, if any did remain; but, if there were but four
heaps, then those remaining cards alone show the number
of spots sought.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—You ought not to see the bottom cards of the
heaps, nor should you see them laid out, or know the
number of cards in each heap; it suffices if you know
the number of heaps and the number of the remaining
cards, if any such there be: and therefore you may
perform this feat as well standing in another room as
if you were present.—You must have a whole pack.</p>

<h3 id="sec_23"><i>To make any two Cards come together which may be
named.</i></h3>

<p>When any one has named what two cards he would
have come together, take the cards and say, “<i>Let us see
if they are here or not, and, if they are, I’ll put them as
far asunder as I can</i>;” then, having found the two cards
proposed, dispose them in the pack, and cause them to
come together.</p>

<p>This trick would seem much more strange, if, when you
have brought the proposed cards together, by laying
them in heaps, you lay the heap wherein the proposed
cards are at the bottom of the pack, and then shuffle the
cards; cut them asunder somewhere in the middle; thus
the proposed cards will be found together in the middle
of the pack, which will seem very strange.</p>

<h3 id="sec_24"><i>Card nailed to the Wall by a Pistol-shot.</i></h3>

<p>A card is desired to be drawn, and the person who
chooses, is requested to tear off a corner, and to keep it,
that he may know the card; the card so torn is then
burnt to cinders, and a pistol discharged with gunpowder,
with which the ashes of the card are mixed.
Instead of a ball, a nail is put into the barrel, which is
marked by some of the company; the pack of cards is
then thrown up in the air, the pistol is fired, and the card
appears <em>nailed</em> against the wall. The bit of the corner
which was torn off is then compared with it, and is found
exactly to fit; and the nail which fastens it to the wall
is recognised by the persons who marked it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
<i>Explanation.</i>—When the performer sees that a corner
of the chosen card has been torn off, he retires, and
makes a similar tear on a like card. Returning, he asks
for the chosen card, and passing it to the bottom of the
pack, he substitutes expertly in its place the card
which he has prepared, which he burns instead of the
first. When the pistol is loaded, he takes it in his hand,
under the pretence of showing how to direct it, &amp;c. He
avails himself of this opportunity to open a hole in the
barrel, near the touchhole, through which the nail falls
by its own weight into his hand: having shut this passage,
he requests one of the company to put more powder
and wadding into the pistol; whilst that is doing, he carries
the nail and card to his confederate, who quickly
nails the card to a piece of square wood, which stops a
space left open in the partition, but which is not perceived,
as it is covered with a piece of tapestry, similar
to the rest of the room; and by which means, when the
nailed card is put on, it is not perceived; the piece of
tapestry which covers it is nicely fastened on the one end
by two pins, and on the other a thread is fastened, one
end of which the confederate holds in his hand. As soon
as the report of the pistol is heard, the confederate draws
his thread, by which means the piece of tapestry falls
behind a glass; the card appears the same that was
marked, and with the nail that was put in the pistol.
It is not astonishing that the trick, being so difficult by
its complexity to be guessed at, should have received
such universal applause.</p>

<p>N. B. After the pistol has been charged with powder,
a tin tube may be slipped upon the charge, into which
the nail being rammed along with the wadding, by inclining
it a little, in presenting it to one of the spectators
to fire, the tube and contents will fall into the performer’s
hand, to convey to his confederate. If any one suspects
that the nail has been stolen out of the pistol, you persist
in the contrary, and beg the company at the next
exhibition to be farther convinced; you then are to show
a pistol, which you take to pieces, to show that all is
fair, without any preparation; you charge it with a nail,
which is marked by some person in confederacy with
you, or you show it to many people, on purpose to avoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
its being marked. In this case the card is nailed with
another nail; but, to persuade the company that it is
the same, you boldly assert that the nail was marked by
several persons, and you request the spectators to view
it, and be convinced.</p>

<h3 id="sec_25"><i>To tell what Card one thinks on.</i></h3>

<p>Take twenty-one cards, and begin to lay them down
three in a row, with their faces upwards; then begin
again at the left hand, and lay one card upon the first,
and so on the right hand, and then begin at the left hand
again, and so go on to the right; do this till you have
laid out the twenty-one cards in three heaps, but, as you
are laying them out, bid any one think of a card, and,
when you have laid them all out, ask him which heap his
card is in; then lay that heap in the middle, between the
other two. Now lay them all out again into three heaps,
as before, and, as you lay them out, bid him take notice
where his noted card goes, and put that heap in the
middle, as before. Then, taking the cards with their
backs towards you, take off the uppermost card, and,
smelling to it, reckon it one; then take off another, and,
smelling to it, reckon it two; this do till you come to the
eleventh card, for that will always be the noted card
after the third time of laying them out, though you
should lay in this manner ever so often. You must
never lay out the cards less than three times, but as often
above as you please. This trick may be done by any
odd number of cards that may be divided by three.</p>

<h3 id="sec_26"><i>Another Way to tell what Card is noted.</i></h3>

<p>When one has noted a card, take it and put it at the
bottom of the pack; then shuffle the cards till it comes
again to the bottom; then see what is the noted card,
which you may do without being taken notice of; when
you have thus shuffled the cards, turn them with their
faces towards you, and knock their ends upon the table,
as though you would knock them level; and, whilst you
are so doing, take notice of the bottom card, which you
may do without suspicion, especially having shuffled
them before; then, when you know the card, shuffle
them again, and give them to any of the company, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
let them shuffle them, for you know the card already,
and may easily find it at any time.</p>

<h3 id="sec_27"><i>To make a Card jump out of an Egg.</i></h3>

<p>To do this wonderful feat you must have two sticks,
made both of one size, so that no person can know one
from another; one of these sticks must be made so as
to conceal a card in the middle, thus: you must have one
of your sticks turned hollow quite through, and then an
artificial spring to throw the card into the egg at pleasure.
The operation is thus:—Take and peel any card in the
pack, which you please, and roll it up. Now put it
into the false stick, and there let it lie until you have
occasion to make use of it. Now take a pack of cards,
and let any body draw one; but be sure to let it be the
same sort of card which you have in the hollow stick.
The person who has chosen it is now to put it into the
pack again, and, while you are shuffling them, let it fall
into your lap. Then, calling for some eggs, desire the
person who drew the card, or any other person in the
company, to choose any one of the eggs. When they
have done so, ask the person if there be any thing in it?
He will answer that there is not. Now take the egg in
your left hand, and the hollow stick in your right, and
then break the egg with the stick.</p>

<div id="ip_20" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 14.8125em;">
  <img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="237" height="79" alt="" /></div>

<p>Having let the spring go, the card will appear in the
egg, to the great amazement of the beholders. Now be
sure to conceal the hollow stick, and produce the solid
one, which place upon the table for the examination of
those who are curious.</p>

<h3 id="sec_28"><i>The Little Sportsman.</i></h3>

<p>This is a little pasteboard figure which holds a bow,
with an arrow, which it shoots at the instant required, and
hits a paper placed opposite, on the top of a pedestal:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<div id="ip_21" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="396" height="219" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">This paper is divided into several squares, which are
numbered, and the arrow flies and always hits the number
chosen by one of the company. The action of the
spring which impels it is restrained by a little pin,
which the confederate lets go at pleasure, by moving the
levers hid in the table; when you push this pin, the
arrow flies with rapidity to the paper, like the operation
of a lock of a musket, when you pull the trigger. In
placing the automaton on the table, you may place it in
such a manner that the arrow be directed towards one
of the circles numbered on the paper. To cause that
number to be chosen against which the arrow is pointed,
you must present to the spectator cards numbered, and
dexterously make him choose the number required,
which depends on peculiar address, that is scarcely possible
to be described by words; it may in general be said
to come under the following heads:—First, to put at the
bottom one of the cards to be chosen; secondly, to keep
it always in the same place, although you mix, or pretend
to mix, the cards; thirdly, to pass the card to the
middle, when you present the pack; fourthly, to pass
many cards before the hands of the spectator, to persuade
him that he may choose indifferently; fifthly, to
pass these same cards with such rapidity, that he cannot
take any but the card intended; sixthly, to slip complaisantly
into his hand the card you wish to be taken,
at the very moment when, the better to deceive him, you
beg of him graciously to take which card he chooses.</p>

<h2 id="chap_3">CUPS AND BALLS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_29"><i>To pass the Balls through the Cups.</i></h3>

<p>You must place yourself at the farther end of the
table, and provide three cups made of tin; you must
likewise have your black magical stick, to show your

cork balls, to play with; but do not let any more than
three of them be seen upon the table.</p>

between the middle finger and the ring finger; and be
sure you make yourself perfect to hold it there, for by
this means all the tricks of the cups are done.</p>

right hand (which you are always to keep private) and
clapping it under the first cup; and, taking up one of
the three balls with your right hand, seem to put it
into your left hand, but retain it still in your right,

clap the ball under your right hand, and, taking the
third ball up with your right hand, seem to put it
into your left hand, but retain it in your right hand; so,
shutting your left hand in due time, as before, saying,
“<i>Presto, make haste</i>”: so you have your three balls come
under your three cups, as thus, and so lay your three
cups down upon the table.</p>

keep in your right hand to play withal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>

down again, convey the ball that you have in your right

“<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, this being the last ball, I take
this and put it in my pocket.</i>” Likewise then say to the

the beholders.</p>

<p>Then take up the first cup, and, clapping the ball under
that you have in your right hand, and taking the
first ball up with the right hand, seem to put the same

<p>Then taking that cup up again, and flinging it under
that you have in your right hand, you must take up the
second ball, and seem to put it into your left hand, but
retain it in your right, saying, “<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,
see how the ball runs on the table.</i>”—So, seeming to

<p class="in0">All the balls being under one cup.</p>

<p>If you can perform these feats with the cups and balls
dexterously, you may change the balls into apples,
pears, plums, or living birds, as your fancy leads you.</p>

<h3 id="sec_30"><i>A still more Extraordinary Mode of Playing at
Cups and Balls.</i></h3>

<p>You must provide six cups made of the same size and
metal (persons with hands, as seen above, require only
three), but keep three of them concealed in the juggling-bag
until they are required.</p>

<p>The trick performed by the three first cups is as
follows:—Take out of the bag your three cups, and
place them on a table. You must have balls of cork
provided, and concealed, but one ball must be on the
table. Then say, “<i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>,” turning
up your three cups (though at the same time you must
have a ball concealed), “<i>you see there is nothing under
my cups; I take and put this cup here; I put the second
there; and the third there</i>.” The ball you have hid must
be clapped under one of the cups at the time you were
placing them.</p>

<p>You must have a tin bottom in the inside of one of
your cups, and holes punched in it like a grater. Then
say, “<i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>,” (taking the ball off the
table, and placing it on the cup the ball is under),
“<i>observe, I cover this ball with this cup</i>,” clapping the
third cup on the other two; then say, “<i>Presto, I command
the ball from under the middle cup to the bottom.</i>”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Then taking off the first and second cups, the ball, they
think, is gone to the bottom; whereas the ball that is
laid on the top of the undermost sticks fast to the grater
that covers it, and, when the cup is turned up, it is the
ball that was conveyed first that appears.</p>

<p>Next place, take the ball that is on the table, and say,
“<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, there is but one ball left</i>,” clapping
the cup with the tin bottom, where the ball is concealed,
over that ball on the table, so as that ball that
was sticking to the tin falls down, and makes two; then
clapping the cup down, convey another ball you have
secured, and say, “<i>Vene tome</i>;” then say, “<i>Ladies
and Gentlemen, there are three balls and three cups</i>;” first
having secured two balls (having some strange gestures
of body and speech to take off the eyes of the spectators),
at the same time taking up one of the cups, but
putting it down on one of the balls, with the two balls
secured; then clap the second cup on the second ball,
and the third cup on the third ball.</p>

<p>Now say, “<i>I’ve covered the three balls.</i>” Then turn
up one cup, and say, “<i>There is the first ball</i>;” then turn
up the other, saying, “<i>There is the second ball.</i>” Then
take up either of the balls, and lay it on the top of the
third cup, and cover it with the cup that has the tin bottom,
clapping the third cup in the place of the other two;
say, “<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, there is one ball at the bottom,
one in the middle, and the third and last ball I strike
through the board, saying, ‘Presto, be gone.’</i>”</p>

<p>Now, you must understand, the third ball you drop,
the second sticks to the tin grater, and three balls
appear under the lowermost cup; then place your three
balls on the table, and your cups opposite the balls;
then say, “<i>I cover this ball with this cup, and I cover
this third ball with this one cup.</i>” Then turning up one
cup, take up the ball, and say, “<i>Presto, I command you
under the second cup</i>;” but at the same time you must
retain the ball, for the ball that was sticking to the
tin is dropped, and makes two; then clapping the cup
down, with the ball that you have retained, turn up the
cup, and say, “<i>I’ll strike this ball to the other two</i>;” and
drop that ball, being three before.</p>

<p>Next place the balls and cups as they were before;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
then clap the first cup on the first ball, and the second
on the second; then take up the cup with the grater,
which generally is in the middle, saying, “<i>I’ll put this
cup in my bag</i>;” and take up this ball, saying, “<i>I’ll put
this ball in my bag</i>;” and take up the next ball, saying,
“<i>I’ll put this ball in my bag too</i>,” clapping under the
cup at the same time the ball you have retained. At last,
say, “<i>I shall have too many balls</i>,” or something to that
purpose; seem in a fury, and toss your cups away; then
put them into your juggling-bag, that, when you show
the other three, the company may think they were the
first cups.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_4">CONVEYANCE OF MONEY, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>

<p>The conveyance of money is not much inferior to the
tricks with Cups and Balls, but much easier to perform.
The principal place to hold the coin is the palm of the
hand; and the best piece to play with is a sixpence.
But, by practice, all coins will be alike, unless they are
very small, and then they must be kept between the fingers,
almost at the fingers’ ends; whereas the ball is to be
kept below, near the palm. The coin ought never to be
too large, as that will considerably impede the clever
conveyance of it.</p>

<h3 id="sec_31"><i>To convey Money from one Hand to the Other.</i></h3>

<p>Hold open your right hand and lay therein a sixpence,
and on the top of it place the top of your left middle finger,
which press hard upon it, at the same time using
hard words. Then suddenly draw away your right hand
from the left, seeming to have left the coin there, and
shut your hand cleverly, as if it still were there. That
this may appear to have been truly done, take a knife,
and seem to knock against it, so as to make a great
sound. This is a pretty trick, and, if well managed,
both the eye and ear are deceived at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="sec_32"><i>To convert Money into Counters, and the Reverse.</i></h3>

<p>Another way to deceive the lookers-on is to do as
before, with a sixpence, and, keeping a counter in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
palm of your left hand, secretly, seem to put the sixpence
therein, which being retained still in the right
hand, when the left hand is opened, the sixpence will
seem to be turned into a counter.</p>

<h3 id="sec_33"><i>To put a Sixpence into each Hand, and, with Words,
bring them together.</i></h3>

<p>He that hath once attained to the faculty of retaining
one piece of money in his right hand may show a
hundred pleasant deceits by that means, and may
manage two or three as well as one. Thus, you may
seem to put one piece into your left hand, and, retaining
it still in your right, you may, together therewith, take
up another like piece, and so, with words, seem to bring
both pieces together. A great variety of tricks may be
shown in juggling with money.</p>

<h3 id="sec_34"><i>To put a Sixpence into a Stranger’s Hand, and
another into your own, and to convey both into
the Stranger’s Hand with Words.</i></h3>

<p>You take two sixpences evenly set together, and put
the same, instead of one sixpence, into a stranger’s
hand, and then, making as though you put one sixpence
into your own hand, with words, you make it seem that
you convey the sixpence in your own into the stranger’s
hand; for, when you open your said left hand, there shall
be nothing seen, and he, opening his hand, shall find two
sixpences, which he thought was but one.</p>

<h3 id="sec_35"><i>To show the same Feat otherwise.</i></h3>

<p>To keep a sixpence between your fingers serves
especially for this and such like purposes: hold your
hand, and cause one to lay a sixpence upon the palm
thereof, then shake the same up almost to your finger’s
end, and putting your thumb upon it, you may easily,
with a little practice, convey the edge betwixt the middle
and fore-finger whilst you proffer to put it into your
other hand (provided always that the edge appears not
through the fingers, on the back side); take up another
sixpence, which you may cause another stander-by to
lay down, and put them both together, either closely,
instead of one into a stranger’s hand, or keep them still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
in your own hand, and, after some words spoken, open
your hands, and, there being nothing in one hand, and
both pieces in the other, the beholders will wonder how
they came together.</p>

<h3 id="sec_36"><i>To throw a Piece of Money away, and find it again.</i></h3>

<p>You may, with the middle or ring finger of the right
hand, convey a sixpence into the palm, with the same
hand, and, seeming to cast it away, keep it still, which,
with confederacy, will seem strange: to wit, when you
find it again, where another has placed the like piece.
But these things cannot be done without practice;
therefore. I will proceed to show how things may be
brought to pass with less difficulty, and yet as strange
as the rest, which, being unknown, are much commended;
but, being known, are derided, and nothing
at all regarded.</p>

<h3 id="sec_37"><i>To make a Sixpence leap out of a Pot or to run
along a Table.</i></h3>

<p>A juggler takes a sixpence and throws it into a pot, or
lays it on the middle of a table, and, with enchanted
words, causes the same to leap out of a pot, or run towards
him or from him along the table, which seems
miraculous till you know how it is done, which is thus:
Take a long black hair of a woman’s head, fasten it to
the rim of a sixpence, by means of a little hole driven
through the same with a Spanish needle. In like sort
you may use a knife or any small thing; but if you
would have it go from you, you must have a confederate,
by which means all juggling is graced and amended.</p>

<p>This feat is the stranger if it be done by night, a
candle being placed between the spectators and the juggler,
for by that means their eyes are hindered from
discerning the deceit.</p>

<h3 id="sec_38"><i>To make a Sixpence sink through a Table, and to
vanish out of a Handkerchief.</i></h3>

<p>A juggler will sometimes borrow a sixpence and mark
it before you, and seem to put the same in the middle of
a white handkerchief, and wind it so as you may the
better see and feel it; then he will take the handkerchief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
and bid you feel whether the sixpence be there or
no; and he will also require you to put the same under
a candlestick, or some such like thing; then he will
send for a basin of water, and, holding the same under
the table, right against the candlestick, he will use certain
words of enchantment, and, in short, you shall hear
the sixpence fall into the basin. This done, let one take
off the candlestick, and the juggler take the handkerchief
by a tassel and shake it; but the money is gone,
which seems as strange a feat as any whatsoever, but,
being known, the miracle is turned to a jest; for it is
nothing else but to sew a sixpence into a corner of the
handkerchief, finely covered with a piece of linen a little
bigger than your sixpence, which corner you must convey,
instead of the sixpence given you, into the middle
of your handkerchief, leaving the other in your hand or
lap, which afterwards you seem to pull through the
table, letting it fall into the basin.</p>

<h3 id="sec_39"><i>To know if a Coin be a Head or Woman, and the
Party to stand in another Room.</i></h3>

<p>This is done by confederacy: he that lays it down,
says, “<i>What is it?</i>” and that is a sign it is a head; or
he says, “<i>What is it now?</i>” and that is a sign it is a
woman: cross and pile in silver is done the same way.
By confederacy, divers strange things are done: thus,
you may throw a piece of money into a pond, and bid
a boy go to such a secret place where you have hid
it, and he will bring it, and make them believe it is the
same that you threw into the pond, and no other.</p>

<p>So let a confederate take a shilling and put it under a
candlestick on a table a good distance from you; then
you must say, “<i>Gentlemen, you see this shilling</i>;” then
take your hand and knock it under the table, and convey
it into your pocket; then say, “<i>The shilling is gone;
but look under such a candlestick and you will find it.</i>”</p>

<h3 id="sec_40"><i>To command Seven Halfpence through the Table.</i></h3>

<p>To do this, you must employ a tinman to make holes,
with room enough for a die to go in and out, and let
him clap a good halfpenny upon them all, and so make
them fast, that nobody can tell them from true ones.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Then get a cap to cover your halfpence, also a cap and
a die for the company to fling, to amuse them; when you
are thus provided, the manner of performing is thus:—Desire
any body in the company to lend you seven halfpence,
telling them that they will soon be returned; then
say, “<i>Gentlemen, this is made just fit for your money</i>;”
then clapping your cap on, desire somebody in the company
to fling that die, and, in so doing, take off the cap,
and convey your false money into it, so that the company
may not see you put it in; then with your cap cover
the die, while with your right hand you take up the true
money, and put it into the left under the table, saying,
“<i>Vado, begone; I command the die to be gone, and the
money to come in the place</i>;” so take up the cap, and the
die is gone, and the money is come. Having covered the
money again with the cap, taking the true money with
your right hand, and knocking under the table, also
making a jingling, as though the money was coming
through the table, fling them on the table, and say,
“<i>There is the money</i>,” and, with your right hand, take
off the cap, saying, “<i>And there is the die</i>;” so convey
the false money into your lap, and there is the cap
likewise.</p>

<h3 id="sec_41"><i>To command a Sixpence out of a Box.</i></h3>

<p>You must get a box turned with two lids (one must be
a false one), and there put the counter, so that it may
rattle; and you must have a small peg or button to your
box, to hinder the counter from jingling, and at the bottom
of the box you must have half a notch made, just fit
for a sixpence to come out. So, to perform this feat, you
must desire any body to lend you a sixpence, and to
mark it with whatever mark he may please; then let him
put it into the box himself; afterwards put the cover
on, and, by shaking the box, the sixpence will come into
your hand, when you may dispose of it as you please.</p>

<h3 id="sec_42"><i>To blow a Sixpence out of another Man’s Hand.</i></h3>

<p>Blow on a sixpence, and immediately clap it into one
of the spectator’s hands, telling him to hold it fast; then
ask him if he is sure he has it. He, to be certain, will
open his hand and look. Then say to him, “<i>Nay, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
if you let my breath go off, I cannot do it.</i>” Then take
it out of his hand again, blow on it, and, staring him in
the face, clap a piece of horn in his hand, and retain the
sixpence, shutting his hand yourself. Bid him hold his
hand down, and slip the sixpence into one of his cuffs;
then say, “<i>I command the money you hold in your hand
to vanish; Vade, now see.</i>” When they have looked, they
will think it is changed by virtue of your stone. Then take
the horn again, and say, “<i>Vade</i>;” and then say, “<i>You
have your money again.</i>” He then will begin to marvel,
and say, “<i>I have not.</i>” Then say to him again, “<i>You
have; and I am sure you have got it: is it not in your
hand? If it be not there, turn down one of your sleeves, for
it is in one, I am sure</i>;” where he, finding it, will not a
little wonder.</p>

<h3 id="sec_43"><i>To make a Ring shift from one Hand to another,
and to make it go on whatever Finger is required,
while Somebody holds both Arms.</i></h3>

<p>Desire some person in company to lend you a gold
ring, recommending him at the same time to make a
mark on it, that he may know it again. Have a gold
ring of your own, which you are to fasten by a small
piece of catgut string to a watch-barrel, which must be
sewn to the left sleeve of your coat. Take in your right
hand the ring that will be given you: then, taking with
dexterity, near the entrance of your sleeve, the other ring
fastened to the watch-barrel, draw it to the fingers’ ends
of your left hand, taking care nobody perceives it. During
this operation, hide between the fingers of your right
hand the ring that has been lent to you, and fasten it
dexterously on a little hook, sewed on purpose on your
waistcoat, near your hips, and hid by your coat.</p>

<p>You will, after that, show your ring, which you hold
in your left hand; then ask the company on which finger
of the other hand they wish it to pass. During this
interval, and as soon as the answer has been given,
put the before-mentioned finger on the little hook, in
order to slip on it the ring; at that moment let go
the other ring, by opening your fingers. The spring
which is in the watch-barrel, not being confined
longer, will contract and make the ring slip under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
sleeve without any body perceiving it, not even those
who hold your arms: as, their only attention being to
prevent your hands from communicating, they will let
you make the necessary motions. These must be very
quick, and always accompanied by stamping of the foot.</p>

<p>After this operation, show the assembly that the ring
is come on the other hand; make them remark that it is
the same that had been lent to you, or that the mark is
right. Much dexterity must be made use of to succeed
in this entertaining trick, that the deception may not
be suspected.</p>

<h3 id="sec_44"><i>To Transfer a Counter into a Silver Groat.</i></h3>

<p>Take a groat, or a smaller piece of money, and grind
it very thin on one side; then take two counters, and grind
them, the one on one side, and the other on the other
side; glue the smooth side of the groat to the smooth
side of the counter, joining them as close together as
possible, especially at the edges, which may be so filed
that they shall seem to be but one piece; to wit, one side a
counter and the other side a groat. Then take a little
green wax, for that is softest, and therefore best, and
lay it on the smooth side of the counter, as it does not
much discolour the groat; and so will that counter, with
the groat, cleave together as though they were glued,
and, being filed even with the groat and the other counter,
it will seem so perfectly like an entire counter, that,
though a stranger handle it, he cannot betray it; then,
having a little touched your fore-finger, and the thumb
of your right hand, with soft wax, take therewith this
counterfeit counter, and lay it openly upon the palm of
your left hand, wringing the same hard, so as you may
leave the glued counter with the groat apparently in the
palm of your left hand, and the smooth side of the waxed
counter will stick fast upon your thumb, by reason of the
wax wherewith it is smeared: and so you may hide it
at your pleasure (always be sure to lay the waxed side
downward, and the glued side upward); then close your
hand, and, in or after closing thereof, turn the piece, and
so, instead of a counter, which they suppose to be in
your hand, you shall seem to have a groat, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
astonishment of the beholders, if it be well handled. The
juggler must not leave any of his tricks wanting for hard
and break-jaw words.</p>

<h3 id="sec_45"><i>To make a Silver Twopence be plain in the Palm of
your Hand, and be passed from thence wherever
you like.</i></h3>

<p>Put a little red wax, not too much, upon the nail of
your longest finger; then let a stranger put a two-penny
piece into the palm of your hand, and shut your fist suddenly,
and convey the two-penny piece upon the wax,
which, with use, you may so accomplish, as no man
shall perceive it; then, and in the meantime, use words
of course, and suddenly open your hand; hold the tips
of your fingers rather lower than the palm of your hand,
and the beholders will wonder where it is gone; then
shut your hand suddenly again, and lay a wager whether
it be there or no, and you may either leave it
there or take it away at pleasure. This, if it be well
handled, hath more admiration than any other feat of the
hand.—Note: This may be best done by putting the wax
upon the two-penny piece, but then you must put it into
your hand yourself.</p>

<h3 id="sec_46"><i>To convey a Sixpence out of the Hand of one that
holds it fast.</i></h3>

<p>Stick a little wax upon your thumb, and take a bystander
by the fingers, showing him the sixpence, and
telling him you will put the same into his hand; then
wring it down hard with your waxed thumb, and, using
many words, look him in the face, and, as soon as you
perceive him look in your face, or on your hand, suddenly
take away your thumb, and close his hand, and it
will seem to him that the sixpence remains. If you
wring a sixpence upon one’s forehead, it will seem to
stick when it is taken away, especially if it be wet; then
cause him to hold his hand still, and, with speed, put
out into another man’s hand, or into your own, two sixpences
instead of one, and use words of course, whereby
you shall make the spectators believe, when they open
their hands, that, by enchantment, you have brought
both together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_47"><i>To convey a Shilling from one Hand into another,
holding your Hands apart.</i></h3>

<p>It is necessary to mingle some merry pranks among
your grave miracles, as, in this case of money, to take a
shilling in each hand, and, holding your arms abroad, to
lay a wager that you will bring them both into one hand
without bringing them any nearer together; the wager
being laid, hold your arms abroad, like a rod, and, turning
about with your body, lay the shilling out of one of
your hands, upon the table, and, turning to the other
hand, so you shall win your wager.</p>

<h3 id="sec_48"><i>To transform any small Thing into any other Form,
by holding of Paper.</i></h3>

<p>Take a sheet of paper, and fold or double the same,
so as one side be a little longer than the other; then put
a counter between the two sides of the leaves of the
paper, up to the middle of the top of the fold; hold the
same so as it be not perceived, and lay a sixpence on the
outside thereof, right against the counter, and fold it
down to the end of the longer side. When you have unfolded
it again, the sixpence will be where the counter
was, so that some will suppose you have transformed
the money into a counter; and with this many tricks
may be done.</p>

<h3 id="sec_49"><i>Another Trick of the same Nature.</i></h3>

<p>Take two papers, three inches square each, divided
into two folds, of three equal parts on either side, so
as each folded paper remains one inch square; then
glue the back side of the two together, as they are
folded, and not as they are opened, and so shall both papers
seem to be but one, and, which side soever you open,
it shall appear to be the same, if you have handsomely
done the bottom, as you may well do with your middle
finger, so that, if you have a sixpence in one hand, and
a counter in the other, you show but one, and you may,
by turning the paper, seem to change it; this is best
performed by putting it under a candlestick or a hat,
and, with words, seem to do the feat, which is by no
means an inferior one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_50"><i>A Watch recovered after being beaten to Pieces in a
Mortar.</i></h3>

<p>A watch is borrowed from one of the company, and,
being put into a mortar, another person is shortly after
requested to beat it to pieces with a pestle. It is then
shown to the company, entirely bruised; in a few
minutes the watch is restored entire to its owner, who
acknowledges it to be his property. It is easy to devise
that, to effect this, the mortar must be placed near a
concerted trap, and that it must be covered with a napkin,
to afford an opportunity to the confederate to substitute
another watch, unperceived by the company. In order
to succeed in the illusion of this trick, you must take
care to provide yourself with a second watch, somewhat
resembling the first in the size, case, &amp;c. which will not
be very difficult, as you may either be furnished with a
watch by a person with whom the matter is preconcerted,
or by addressing yourself to some one whose
watch you have before observed, and procured yourself
one like it. After having placed all the pieces in the
mortar, you must cover them a second time with a napkin,
and whilst you amuse the company with some trick
or story, you afford time to your confederate to take the
bruised pieces away, and replace the first watch in the
mortar.</p>

<h2 id="chap_5">TRICKS WITH BOXES, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_51"><i>The Egg-Box.</i></h3>

<div id="ip_38" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 8.375em;">
  <img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="134" height="235" alt="" /></div>

<p>This is the Egg-box, put together like two beehives—one
on the top of another. The following is the under-shell,</p>

<div id="ip_38b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 7.3125em;">
  <img src="images/i_044b.jpg" width="117" height="85" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">covered over artificially with the white thin skin of
a real egg. The upper shell is of the same shape, but</p>

<div id="ip_38c" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 7.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_044c.jpg" width="127" height="94" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">larger, and is merely the lid of the box. The following</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<div id="ip_39" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 8.0625em;">
  <img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="129" height="133" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">is the lower part of the box. Put B, which is the outward
shell, upon C, and both upon D, which arrangement
puts all in readiness for the performance of the
trick. Now call for an egg, and bid all the bystanders
look at it, to see that it is a real egg. Then take off the
upper part, B C, with your fore-finger and thumb, and
placing the egg in the box, say, “<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,
you see it fairly in the box</i>;” and, uncovering it
again, say, “<i>You shall see me fairly take it out</i>;” putting
it into your pocket in their sight. Now open your box
again, and say, “<i>There’s nothing</i>;” close your hand
about the middle of the box, and, taking B by the bottom,
say, “<i>There is the egg again</i>;” which appears to
the spectators to be the same that you put in your
pocket; then clapping that on again, and taking the lid
of C between your fore-finger and thumb, say, “<i>It is
gone again.</i>”</p>

<h3 id="sec_52"><i>The Penetrative Guinea.</i></h3>

<p>Provide a round tin box, of the size of a large snuff-box,
and likewise eight other boxes, which will go easily
into each other, and let the least of them be of a size to
hold a guinea. Each of these boxes should shut with a
hinge, and to the least of them there must be a small
lock, that is fastened with a spring, but cannot be opened
without a key; and observe, that all these boxes must
shut so freely, that they may be all closed at once.
Place these boxes in each other, with their tops open, in
the drawer of the table on which you make your experiments;
or, if you please, in your pocket, in such a manner
that they cannot be displaced. Then ask a person
to lend you a new guinea, and desire him to mark it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
that it may not be changed. You take this piece in one
hand, and in the other you have another of the same
appearance, and, putting your hand in the drawer, you
slip the piece that is marked into the least box, and,
shutting them all at once, you take them out. Then
showing the piece you have in your hand, and which
the company suppose to be the same that was marked,
you pretend to make it pass through the box, and dexterously
convey it away. You then present the box, for
the spectators do not yet know there are more than one,
to any person in company, who, when he opens it, finds
another, and another, till he comes to the last, but that
he cannot open without the key, which you then give
him; and, retiring to a distant part of the room, you
tell him to take out the guinea himself, and see if it be
that he marked.</p>

<p>This trick may be made more surprising by putting
the key into the snuff-box of one of the company; which
you may do by asking for a pinch of snuff: the key, being
very small, will lie concealed among the snuff. When
the person who opens the box asks for the key, tell him
that one of his friends has it in his snuff-box, which will
cause much amazement and merriment. This part of
the trick may be done with a confederate.</p>

<h3 id="sec_53"><i>The Chest which opens at Command.</i></h3>

<p>There is a little figure of Mahomet within the chest,
in the body of which is a spring, made of brass wire,
twisted in a spiral form. By this means the little figure,
though higher than the chest, can, by the accommodation
of the spring, be contained within when it is shut,
as the spring in the body closes and shortens. The chest
is placed on levers concealed in the table, which communicate
their motions by the assistance of the confederate
to the bolt and lock. As soon as the staple is disengaged,
the spring in the body of the figure, finding no
resistance but the weight of the lid, forces it open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_54"><i>The Melting-Box.</i></h3>

<p>The melting-box is made in the fashion of a screw, so
that the lips may hang without discovery.</p>

<div id="ip_41" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 16.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="268" height="117" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">F <span class="in4">G</span></div></div>

<p>F is the outer part of the box; G, the first inside part;</p>

<div id="ip_41b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 15.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_047b.jpg" width="248" height="134" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">H <span class="in4">I</span></div></div>

<p class="in0">H, the second inside part; and I, the round case,
made of leather, with a button on the top, and wide
enough to slip on and off, half in the bottom of the box,
into which put a small quantity of quicksilver, killed or
amalgamated, which may be done with the shavings
of pewter. In the second part, which is H, let there
be six single pence: put these in the first or outermost
part, then put G to H, and the box is perfect.</p>

<p>When you go to show this trick, desire any in the
company to lend you a sixpence, saying, “<i>you will return
it safe</i>”; requesting, withal, that none will meddle with
any thing they see, unless you desire them, lest they prejudice
you and themselves. Then take the cap off
your box, and bid any one see it and feel it, that there
be no mistrust; so likewise take the box entire, holding
your fore-finger on the bottom, and your thumb on
the upper part, turning it upside-down, and say,—“<i>You
see here is nothing</i>:” then putting in the sixpence,
put the cap over the box again; as the box stands covered
upon the table, put your hand under the table, using
some cant words; then take off the cap with your
fore-finger and thumb, so as you pinch the innermost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
box with it and set it gently on the table; then put
the dead quicksilver out of the lower part, into your
hand, turning the box with the bottom upwards, and
stirring it about with your fore-finger; then say, “<i>Here
you see it melted, now I will put it in again, and turn it into
single pence</i>;” suddenly take the cap as you took it off,
and return it again; bid them blow on it; then take off
the cap as you did before, only pinching the uppermost
lid in it, and setting it upon the table; hold the box at
the top and bottom, with your fore-finger and thumb;
then put the six single pence, after they are viewed, and
seen to be so, in again, and return the cap as before,
saying, “<i>Blow on it if you would have it in the same form
you gave it me</i>;” then taking the cap by the bottom, holding
the box as before, put out the sixpence, and return
the box into your pocket. This is a very good sleight, if
well performed.</p>

<h3 id="sec_55"><i>Trick upon the Globe-Box.</i></h3>

<p>This is a trick not inferior to the best that is shown with
boxes: it is a box made of four pieces, and a ball, so
big as is imagined to be contained therein; the ball
serves in the same way as the egg does in the egg-box,
only to deceive the hand and eye of the spectators:
this ball, made of wood or ivory, is thrown out of the
box upon the table, for every one to see that it is substantial;
then, putting the ball into the box, and letting
the standers-by blow on the box, taking off the upper
shell with your fore-finger and thumb, there appears
another, and of another colour,—as red, blue, yellow,
or any variety of colours upon each ball that is so
imagined to be, which, indeed, is no more than the shell
of wood, ingeniously turned and fitted for the box, as
you may see in the following <span class="locked">figures:—</span></p>

<div id="ip_42" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.0625em;">

P <span class="in4">M</span><br />
R <span class="in4">O</span><br />
Q <span class="in4">S</span>
</div></div>

<p>L is the outer shell of the globe, taken off the figures
M N, an inner shell; O, the cover of the same; P, the
other inner shell; Q, the cover of the same; R, the third
shell; S, that which covers it. These globes may be
made of more or less variety, according to the wish of
the operator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_56"><i>Trick with the Funnel.</i></h3>

<div id="ip_44" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 12.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="201" height="238" alt="" /></div>

<p>You must get a double funnel; that is, two funnels
soldered one within the other, so that you may, at the
least end, pour in a quantity of wine or water; this funnel
you must have ready filled beforehand, with whatsoever
liquor you please, and call for some of the same
kind; then draw the funnel, and, setting your middle
finger under the bottom of it, bid somebody (or do
it yourself) pour it full, and drink it up before them,
and turn the broad end of the funnel downwards, saying,
“<i>Gentlemen, all is gone</i>;” and in a thrice turn
yourself about, and, in turning, pronounce some term of
art; withdraw your finger from the narrow end, and let
the liquor out between the funnels, and it will be
thought to be that which you drank out of the funnel,
and so you may persuade them it is the same.</p>

<h3 id="sec_57"><i>The Magical Bell and Bushel.</i></h3>

<p>This bushel must be turned neatly, like the egg-boxes,
so that they cannot find out where it opens; and
you must have a false lid to clap on and off, and upon
that false lid glue some bird-seed; and then you must
have a true lid made to clap neatly upon the false one;
now you must have your artificial bell to show with your
bushel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
You may make your bell with wood or brass; but it
must be made to unscrew at top, that it may hold as
much seed as your bushel will when it is filled; and
you must have the handle of your bell made with a
spring, so as to let the seed fall down at your word of
command.</p>

<div id="ip_45" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 17.3125em;">
  <img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="277" height="169" alt="" /></div>

<p>The manner of using them is as follows:—Fill the top
with bird-seed, before you begin to exhibit, saying,
“<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you see I have nothing in my
bell</i>,” (which they cannot do, if you hold it by the
handle,) “<i>nor have I any thing in my bushel; therefore I
will fill the bushel with bird-seed</i>.” In filling it, clap on
the false lid, and no person will be able to discover the
deception.</p>

<p>Now ask any one of the company to hold it in their
hands whilst you command all the seed to appear under
the magic bell. Then clap the true lid on, and ring the
bell; accordingly, the seed will be gone out of the
bushel into the bell, to the great wonder of the bystanders.</p>

<h3 id="sec_58"><i>Out of an Empty Bag to bring upwards of an Hundred
Eggs; and, afterwards, a living Fowl.</i></h3>

<p>First, buy two or three yards of printed calico, or
linen, and make a double bag, at the mouth of which,
on that side next you, make four or five little purses, in
each of which put two or three eggs, and do so till you
have filled that side next to you. Have a hole made at
one end of the bag, that no more than two or three eggs
may come out at once. Then have another bag like unto
that exactly, that one must not be known from the other;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
put a hen into that bag, and hang it on a hook on the
side you stand. The manner of performing it is thus:
take the egg-bag and put both your hands in it; then turn
it inside out, and say, “<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you see
here is nothing in my bag</i>;” and in turning it again you
must slip some of the eggs out of the purses, as many as
you think fit: then turn your bag again, and show the
company that it is empty, and in turning it command
more eggs to come out. When all are come out but one,
you are to take that egg and show it to the company,
and then drop down the egg-bag and take up the hen-bag.
Now, shake out the hen, pigeon, or other fowl.
This, altogether, is a noble trick, if well executed.</p>

<h3 id="sec_59"><i>Bonus Genius; or, Hiccius Doctius.</i></h3>

<div id="ip_46" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 17.0625em;">
  <img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="273" height="257" alt="" /></div>

<p>You must have the figure of a man made of wood,
about the bigness of your little finger, the head whereof
must be made to take off and put on at pleasure, by
means of a wire that is in the neck; also, you must
have a cloth cap, with a little bag within, to convey the
head into; the bag must be neatly made, that it may not
easily be perceived; show your man to the company,
and say, “<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this I call my Bonus
Genius</i>;” then show the cap, saying, “<i>This is his coat</i>;”
say moreover, “<i>look now as steadfastly as you can, nevertheless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
I will cozen you, for therefore am I come</i>;” then
hold your cap above your face, and take your man in
your right hand, and put his head through the hole of
the cap, saying, “<i>Now he is ready to go on any message
I have to send him,—to Spain or Italy, or where I will, but
he must have somewhat to bear his charges</i>;” with that,
pull out your right hand from under your cap, and
therewith the body, but, privately putting your right
hand into your pocket, as if you felt for money, where
you may have the body, and take out your hand and say,
“<i>There are three crowns for you, now begone</i>;” then turn
the head, and say, “<i>But he will look about him before he
goes</i>;” then say (setting your fore-fingers upon his
crown), “<i>Just as I thrust my fore-finger down, so he
shall vanish</i>;” and therewith, by the assistance of your
left hand that is under the cap, convey his head into
the little bag within the cap; then turn your cap about,
and say, “<i>See here, he is gone</i>;” then take your cap and
hold it up again, drawing the head out of the little bag,
and say, “<i>Hic mecut genius</i>;” and in the meantime
thrust the head through the hole of the cap, and, holding
the head by the wire, turn it about presently, and put
the head into your pocket.</p>

<h3 id="sec_60"><i>To make a Knife leap out of a Pot.</i></h3>

<p>Have a pot full of water standing on a table; then
take a piece of whalebone, about three inches long,—let
it be pretty stiff, that it may spring the better: take also
a new stiff card, and fold it down the middle, longways;
cut a hole through both folds at each end, half an inch,
or more, from the ends; put one end of the whalebone
in at one end of the card, bend it like a bow, and then
put the other end of the whalebone into the other end of
the card; set this in the pot, two inches deep in the
water; then place the handle of the knife upon the uppermost
part of the whalebone, with the point upwards,
and use some words of art, as <i>Presto, begone!</i> when it
springs out.</p>

<h3 id="sec_61"><i>To turn a Box of Bird-seed into a living Bird.</i></h3>

<p>You must have a box made on purpose, with a false
lid. It must be turned neatly, like the egg-boxes, so
that it cannot be perceived where it opens. You must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
likewise have a false lid to clap on and to take off.
On that lid glue some bird-seed. Before you show the
box to the company, put a bird into it; put on the false lid,
and then show the box to the bystanders. It will seem to
be full of seeds. Now put on the true lid, saying,
“<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I command all the seeds out of
my box, and order a living bird to appear</i>;” which it will
do when the cover is taken off.</p>

<h2 id="chap_6">EXPERIMENTS WITH FIRE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_62"><i>To produce a Carmine Red Flame.</i></h3>

<p>The flame of spirit of wine may be coloured by the
addition of various bodies which the spirit holds in solution,
or which are mixed with it.</p>

<p>The flame of alcohol, or spirit of wine, is tinged red in
the following manner: put into a small iron ladle, one
part of <i>muriate of strontia</i>, and pour over it three or four
of <i>alcohol</i>; then set it on fire with a candle, or a piece of
burning paper; it will burn with a bright red carmine
flame, especially if the mixture be heated, by holding
the ladle over a candle or lamp, to cause the alcohol to
boil rapidly.</p>

<p>The muriate of strontia left behind, after being again
thoroughly dried, may be used again for the same purpose
repeatedly.</p>

<h3 id="sec_63"><i>An Orange-coloured Flame.</i></h3>

<p>Put <i>muriate of lime</i> deprived of the water of crystallization,
into an iron ladle, cover it with spirit of wine,
and it will then burn in the manner stated.</p>

<p>To prepare the muriate of lime, dissolve common
marble in muriatic acid, and evaporate the solution to
perfect dryness.</p>

<h3 id="sec_64"><i>To make Balloons with Soap and Water that catch
Fire and detonate.</i></h3>

<p>Fill with hydrogen gas a bladder with a cock fixed to
it; to which adapt a copper tobacco pipe: dip the bowl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of the pipe into soap-lather; press gently on the bladder
filled with inflammable air, and a small soap bubble
will issue, which, instead of falling to the ground, will
rise most rapidly.</p>

<p>Instead of pure hydrogen gas only, fill the bladder
with a mixture of one third of atmospheric air and two
thirds of hydrogen gas: and, when they arise in the air,
hold a candle to them, and the report will be like that of
a pistol.</p>

<h3 id="sec_65"><i>A Brilliant Blue Flame.</i></h3>

<p>Mix boracic acid in spirits of wine, set the solution
on fire, and the above effect will ensue.</p>

<h3 id="sec_66"><i>An Emerald Green Flame.</i></h3>

<p>Prepare nitrate of copper, thus:—let copper clippings
or filings be dissolved in a sufficient quantity of nitric
acid, of a moderate strength; when no further effervescence
ensues, boil the acid gently upon the copper, until
a pellicle appears; decant the solution, evaporate it
slowly, and, when a very strong pellicle or skin appears,
suffer it to crystallize. The salt is of a fine blue
colour. Then cause the alcohol (spirit of wine) to burn
upon this nitrate of copper, and it will exhibit a beautiful
emerald green colour.</p>

<h3 id="sec_67"><i>Loud Detonations, like the Discharge of Artillery.</i></h3>

<p>Put into a bottle, not quite transparent, half an ounce
of iron filings, over which pour four ounces of pure
water; add one ounce of sulphuric acid, and shake the
mixture.</p>

<p>If you apply a lighted paper tied to the end of a stick,
near the top of the bottle, an instantaneous vivid flame
will suddenly dart from the bottom, accompanied by a
tolerably loud detonation.</p>

<p>Fifteen or twenty successive loud reports may likewise
be obtained, by touching the aperture of the bottle
with a lighted wax taper, fastened to a stick.</p>

<p>Though this experiment offers no very evident
danger to the operator, it would be as well to envelop
the bottle in a cloth, to guard against accidents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_68"><i>A Well of Fire.</i></h3>

<p>Add gradually one ounce, by measure, of sulphuric
acid, to five or six ounces of water, contained in an
earthenware basin, and add to it also, gradually, about
three quarters of an ounce of granulated zinc. A rapid
production of hydrogen gas will instantly take place.
Then add, from time to time, a few pieces of phosphorus
of the size of a pea. A multitude of gas-bubbles will
be produced, which take fire on the surface of the effervescing
liquid; the whole surface of the liquid will become
luminous, and fire-balls, with jets of fire, will dart
from the bottom, through the fluid, with great rapidity,
and a hissing noise.</p>

<h3 id="sec_69"><i>To make a Room seem all on Fire.</i></h3>

<p>Take sal ammoniac half an ounce, camphor one
ounce, aquæ vitæ two ounces; put them into an earthen
pot in the fashion of a chamber-pot, but narrow something
upon the top; then set fire to it, and the room will
seem, to them that are in it, to be all on fire.</p>

<h3 id="sec_70"><i>To walk on a hot Iron Bar, without Danger of
Burning.</i></h3>

<p>Take half an ounce of camphor, dissolve it in two
ounces of aquæ vitæ, add to it one ounce of quicksilver,
one ounce of liquid storax, which hinders the camphor
from firing; take also two ounces of <i>hematitis</i>, a red
stone, to be had at the druggist’s; and when you buy it,
let them beat it to powder in their great mortar, for it is
so very hard that it cannot be done in a small one; put
this to the above-mentioned composition, and, when you
intend to walk on the bar, you must anoint your feet well
therewith, and you may walk over without danger. By
this you may wash your hands in boiling lead.</p>

<h3 id="sec_71"><i>To Eat Fire, and blow it up in your Mouth with a
Pair of Bellows.</i></h3>

<p>Anoint your tongue with liquid storax, and you may
put a pair of tongs into your mouth, red hot, without
hurting yourself, and lick them till they are cold. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the help of this ointment, and by preparing your mouth
thus,</p>

<div id="ip_51" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 18.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="302" height="344" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">you may take wood-coals out of the fire, and chew them
as you would bread; dip them into brimstone
powder, and the fire will seem more strange. The sulphur
puts out the coal, and shutting your mouth close
puts out the sulphur. You may then chump the coals
and swallow them, which you may do without offence
to the body. In the same way, if you put a piece of
lighted charcoal into your mouth, you may suffer a pair
of bellows to be blowing in your mouth continually, and
receive no hurt; but your mouth must be quickly
cleaned, otherwise it will cause a salivation. It is a
very dangerous thing to be done; and although those
that practise it use all the means they can to prevent
danger, yet I never saw any of those fire-eaters that had
a good complexion. Some put bole ammoniac into this
recipe, a thing which spoils the whole composition, and
so leave out hematitis and liquid storax; but let them
beware how they use it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_72"><i>To Light a Candle by a Glass of Water.</i></h3>

<p>Take a little piece of phosphorus of the size of a pinhead,
and with a piece of tallow stick it on the edge of
a drinking-glass. Then take a lighted candle, and, having
blown it out, apply it to the glass, when it will immediately
be lighted. You may likewise write with a bit
of phosphorus on paper some horrible words, which will
appear awful when the candle is withdrawn from the
room.</p>

<h3 id="sec_73"><i>Fulminating Powder.</i></h3>

<p>Take three parts of saltpetre, two parts of salt of
tartar, and one part of sulphur pounded and mixed together;
heat sixty grains of this composition in a spoon,
and it will fly away with a fearful noise, like thunder.
A grain by weight of this powder, put into a tobacco-pipe,
will cause a loud report and much merriment, particularly
if the smoaker is not aware of the trick put
upon him.</p>

<h3 id="sec_74"><i>To set fire to a Combustible Body by the Reflection
of two concave Mirrors.</i></h3>

<p>The rays of a luminous body, placed in the focus of a
concave mirror, being reflected in parallel lines, if a
second mirror be placed diametrically opposite the first,
it will, by collecting those rays in its focus, set fire to a
combustible body.</p>

<p>Place two concave mirrors at about twelve or fifteen
feet distance from each other, and let the axis of each of
them lie in the same line. In the focus of one of them
place a live coal, and in the focus of the other some gunpowder.
With a pair of double bellows, which make a
continual blast, keep constantly blowing the coal, and,
notwithstanding the distance between them, the powder
will presently take fire.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that these mirrors be of metal or
glass; those made of wood or pasteboard, gilded, will
produce the explosion, which has sometimes taken effect
at the distance of fifty feet, when mirrors of eighteen
inches or two feet diameter have been used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_75"><i>To give the Faces of the Company the Appearance of
Death.</i></h3>

<p>Dissolve some common salt in spirits of wine, and
pour the whole on some saffron in a saucer. Take away
the candle from the room, and set fire to the spirit with
a little burning tow. The countenances of every person
in the room will, by this light, put on a cadaverous,
deadly appearance, the fairest complexion appearing
green, whilst the red of the lips and cheeks will be of an
olive hue.</p>

<h3 id="sec_76"><i>To dispose two little Figures, so that one shall light
a Candle, and the other put it out.</i></h3>

<p>Take two little figures of wood or clay, or any other
materials you please, only taking care there is a little
hole at the mouth of each. Put in the mouth of one a
few grains of bruised gunpowder, and a little bit of
phosphorus in the other, taking care that these preparations
are made beforehand; then take a lighted wax
candle, and present it to the mouth of the figure with
the gunpowder, which, taking fire, will put the candle
out; then present your candle, having the snuff quite hot,
to the other figure; it will light again immediately by
means of the phosphorus. You may propose the same
effect to be produced by two figures, drawn on a wall
with a pencil or a coal, by applying, with starch or a
wafer, a few grains of bruised gunpowder to the mouth
of one, and a bit of phosphorus to the mouth of the other.</p>

<h3 id="sec_77"><i>To construct a Lantern which will enable a Person
to read by Night, at a great Distance.</i></h3>

<p>Make a lantern of a cylindric form, or shaped like a
small cask placed lengthways, so that its axis may be
horizontal, and fix in one end of it a parabolic or spheric
mirror, so that its focus may fall about the middle of the
axis of the cylinder. If a small lamp or taper be placed
in this focus, the light, passing through the other end,
will be reflected to a great distance, and will be so
bright, that very small letters on a remote object may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
read, by looking at them with a good telescope. Those
who see this light, if they be in the direction of the axis
of the lantern, will think they see a large fire.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_7">TRICKS WITH STRINGS, KNOTS, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_78"><i>To cut a Lace asunder in the Middle, and to make it
whole again.</i></h3>

<p>Provide a piece of the lace which you mean to cut, or
at least a pattern like the same, one inch and a half long,
and keep it double privately in your left hand, between
some of your fingers, near to the tips thereof;
take the other lace which you mean to cut, still hanging
about your neck, and draw down your said left hand to
the bout thereof, and, putting your own piece a little
before the other, the end, or rather middle, whereof you
must hide betwixt your fore-finger and thumb, make the
eye or bout which shall be seen of your own pattern;
let a bystander cut the same asunder, and it will be
surely thought that the other lace is cut; which, with
words and fretting, you shall seem to renew, and make
whole again. This, if it be well handled, will seem very
wonderful.</p>

<h3 id="sec_79"><i>To burn a Thread and make it Whole again with
the Ashes.</i></h3>

<p>Take two pieces of thread of one foot in length
each: roll one of them round like a small pea, which
put between your left fore-finger and thumb. Now,
hold the other out at length, between the fore-finger and
thumb of each hand, holding all your fore-fingers daintily;
then let one cut the same asunder in the middle;
when that is done, put the tops of your two thumbs together,
and so shall you with less suspicion receive the
thread which you hold in your right hand into your left,
without opening your left finger and thumb. Then holding
these two pieces as you did before it was cut, let
these two be cut also asunder in the middle, and they
conveyed again as before, until they be very short; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
roll all these ends together, and keep that ball of thread
before the other in the left hand, and, with a knife,
thrust the same into a candle, where you may hold it
until the said ball of thread be burnt to ashes; then pull
back the knife with your right hand, and leave the ashes,
with the other ball betwixt your fore-finger and thumb
of your left hand, and, with the two thumbs and two
fore-fingers together, take pains to rub the ashes till your
thread be renewed, and draw out that thread at length,
which you lay all this while betwixt your fore-finger and
thumb. This is not inferior to any juggler’s trick, if it
be well handled; for if you are so perfect in legerdemain
as to bestow the same ball of thread, and to change
it from place to place, betwixt your other fingers, as
may be easily done, then it will seem very strange.</p>

<h3 id="sec_80"><i>To pull many Yards of Ribbon out of the Mouth.</i></h3>

<p>Jugglers get money from maids, by selling laces by
the yard, putting into their mouths one round bottom, as
fast as they pull out another, and, at the exact end of
every yard, they tie a knot, so as the same rests upon
their teeth; then they cut off the same, and so the beholders
are doubly and trebly deceived, seeing as much
lace as will fill a hat, and the same of what colour they
like, to be drawn out of the mouth; and yet the juggler
talks as though there was nothing in his mouth.</p>

<h3 id="sec_81"><i>To cut a Piece of Tape into four Parts, and make it
Whole again with Words.</i></h3>

<p>Take a piece of narrow white tape, about two or three
yards long. First present it to view to any that may desire
it; then tie both the ends of it together, and take one
side of it into one hand, so that the knot may be about
the middle of one side, and, using some circumstantial
words to beguile the spectators, turn one hand about toward
yourself, and the other from you; so shall you twist
the tape once, then clap the ends together, and then, if
you slip your finger and thumb of each hand between the
tape, almost as one would hold a skein of thread to be
wound, this will make one fold or twist, as thus appears,
where A signifieth the twist or fold—B the knot. Then</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<div id="ip_56" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="384" height="456" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">in like manner make a second fold, about the line D C,
as you may see by the second figure, where B signifieth
the knot, C the first fold, and A the second fold;
then hold the fore-finger and thumb of your left hand
upon the second twist, and upon the knot also, and the
fore-finger and thumb of your right hand upon the first
fold C, and desire some one of your spectators to cut all
asunder with a sharp knife at the cross line E D; when
it is cut, hold still your left hand, and let all the ends
fall that you hold in your right hand, for there will be a
show of eight ends, four above and four below, and so
the strings will be thought to be cut into four parts, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
may be seen by the third figure; then gather up the
ends that you let fall into your left hand, and deliver
two of the ends (seeming to take them at random) unto
two several persons, bidding them hold them fast, still
keeping your left-hand fingers upon the twists or folds;
then with both your hands seem to tumble all the ends
together that you had in your left hand, twist out the
slips and pieces, which are three, as you may see at A
and B in the third figure,—twist them all, I say, into a
little ball, and conceal it between some of your fingers
of your left hand, and crumble thereon another confused
heap, and, after some words said, with your right hand
deliver this confused heap unto any of the company,
bidding them hold it fast, saying, “<i>Hulla passa</i>;” then
bid them look on it, and while they are greedily looking
after the event, you may with ease convey the ball or
roll of ends into your pocket; so it will be thought that
you have made it whole by virtue of your words. This
is an excellent trick, if it be gracefully handled: it cost
me a great deal of trouble and time to find it out.</p>

<h3 id="sec_82"><i>To unloose a Knot upon a Handkerchief by Words.</i></h3>

<p>Make a plain loose knot with two ends of a handkerchief,
seeming to draw the same very hard. Hold fast
the body of the handkerchief near to the knot, with your
right hand, pulling the contrary end with your left.
Then close up handsomely the knot, which will be somewhat
loose, and pull the handkerchief so with your
right hand, that the left hand may be near the knot; then
will it seem to be a true and firm knot; and to make it
appear more assuredly to be so indeed, let a stranger
pull at the end which you hold in your left hand, while
you hold fast the other in your right hand, and then
holding the knot with your fore-finger and thumb, and
the lower part of your handkerchief with your other
finger, as you hold a bridle when you would with one
hand slip up the knot and lengthen the reins. This
done, turn your handkerchief over the knot with your
left hand; in doing whereof you must suddenly slip out
the end or corner, putting up the knot of your handkerchief
with your fore-finger and thumb, as you would put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the aforesaid knot of your bridle. Then deliver the
same, covered and wrapped within the midst of the
handkerchief, to one to hold fast, and, after the pronunciation
of some words of art, take the handkerchief and
shake it, and it will be loose.</p>

<h3 id="sec_83"><i>To draw a Cord through the Nose.</i></h3>

<p>This trick is called the bridle, being made of two alder
<span class="locked">sticks—</span></p>

<div id="ip_58" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.125em;">
  <img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="354" height="411" alt="" /></div>

<p>Through the hollowness thereof is placed a cord, the
same being put upon the nose, like a pair of pincers or
tongs; the cord which goeth round the same being
drawn to and fro, the beholders will think the cord goes
through your nose very dangerously; the knots at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
end of the cord, which stay the same from being drawn
out of the stick, must not be put at the very top, for that
must be stopped up, but half an inch beneath each end;
and so, when it is pulled, it will seem to pass through the
nose. Then you may take a knife and seem to cut the
cord asunder, and pull the bridle from your nose.</p>

<h3 id="sec_84"><i>To take three Button-Moulds off a String.</i></h3>

<p>Take two little whipcords, of two feet long each,
double them equally, so as there may appear four ends;
then take three button-moulds (the hole of one of them
must be bigger than the rest), and put one button-mould
upon the eye or bout of one cord, and another on the other
cord; then take the button-mould with the greatest hole,
and let both the bouts be hidden therein, which may be
the better done if you put the eye, or bout, of the one</p>

<div id="ip_59" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="415" height="219" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">into the eye or bout of the other; then put the middle button
upon the same, being doubled over his fellow: so will the
heads seem to be put over the two cords. You may loose
them as you like, and make it seem manifest to the beholders,
who may not see how they are done; but that the
buttons are put upon the two cords, without any fraud.
Then must you seem to add a more effectual binding of those
buttons to the strings, and make one half of a knot with
one of the ends of each side, which is for no other purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
but that, when the buttons are taken away, the
cords may be seen in the case which the beholders suppose
to be in before; for when you have made your half
knots, which in any wise you must not double to make a
perfect knot, you must deliver into the hands of some bystanders
these two cords—namely, two cords evenly set
to one hand, and two in the other, and then with a wager
begin to pull off the buttons, which, if you handle
nimbly, and in the end cause him to pull his two ends,
the two cords will show to be placed plainly, and the
buttons to have come through the cords.</p>

<h2 id="chap_8">OPTICAL ILLUSIONS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_85"><i>The Multiplying Mirror.</i></h3>

<p>A mirror is to be made as follows: first make a hoop
or fillet of wood about the width of a half-crown piece,
and let the thickness be about a quarter of an inch. In
the middle of this hoop fasten a bottom of wood or brass,
and place several hooks of the size of small peas. Then
open the one side of this bottom, set in a piece of crystal
glass, and fasten it in the hoop close to the bottom;</p>

<div id="ip_60" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.25em;">
  <img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="372" height="187" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">then take a quantity of quicksilver, and put so much
into the hoop as will cover the bottom; then let into the
hoop another piece of crystal glass fitted thereto, and
cement the sides that the quicksilver may not run out,
and it is done,—the use whereof I shall not insist upon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
since he that is versed in optical illusions will better
conceive it, than any words of mine can either direct
or assist him.</p>

<h3 id="sec_86"><i>The Magic-Lantern.</i></h3>

<p>This lantern is called magical on account of the formidable
apparitions that, by virtue of light, show upon
the white wall of a dark room. The body of it is generally
made of tin, and of the shape of a lamp. Towards
the back is a concave looking-glass of metal, which may
either be spherical or parabolical, and which, by a grove
made in the bottom of the lantern, may be either advanced
nearer or put farther back from the lamp, in which
is oil or spirit of wine; and the match ought to be a little
thick, that when it is lighted it may cast a good light
that may easily reflect from the glass to the fore part of
the lantern, where there is an aperture with a prospective
in it, composed of two glasses, that make the rays
converge and magnify the object.</p>

<p>When you mean to make use of this admirable machine,
light the lamp, the light of which will be much
augmented by the looking-glass at a reasonable distance.
Between the fore part of the lantern and the
prospective glass you have a trough, made on purpose,
in which you are to run along a flat frame, with transparent
colours on glass. Then all these little figures,
passing successively before the prospective glass, through
which passes the light of the lamp, will be painted and
represented with the same colours upon the wall of a
dark room, and in a gigantic and monstrous manner.</p>

<p>By this lantern you may show birds, beasts, and all
sorts of fish, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<h3 id="sec_87"><i>The Phantascope.</i></h3>

<p>The Phantascope is a magic-lantern improved; that
is, it will magnify or diminish the figures it is to reflect,
without impairing their neatness.</p>

<p>This instrument is composed of a tin box, surmounted
by a kind of chimney, pierced on one of its faces with a
hole of a diameter corresponding with that of the cylinders,
sliding into one another like the tubes of an opera-glass:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
this tube is adjusted by means of a slide established
above the aperture made in the phantascope.
The part of the adjoining cylinder is so adjusted to receive
alternately wooden tablets, in which are opened
cavities to contain the figures painted upon glass. The
flat side of the half ball is placed in that tube, nearly
close enough to touch the painted figures: this half ball
is called the object glass.</p>

<p>In the second cylinder is found a magnifying-glass,
convex on both sides, the focus whereof is double to
that of the half ball, and one third of its diameter: this
glass is called “the eye-glass.” It is by means of drawing
those glasses close that the objects are magnified;
and by removing them at a distance, that the figures are
made to look smaller. Inside of the box is placed one
of those lamps called “argand,” of a wide diameter,
with a concave mirror, to throw as much light as possible
upon the transparent figures.</p>

<p>To exhibit the phantasmagoria, select an apartment
opening into a second room, and the door of which is at
your disposal: take a wooden frame, exactly of the same
dimensions as that door, upon which fasten, with brass
nails, a sheet of fine linen, in preference to calico. A
moment before you place the frame, wet it equally all
over, to cause the thread of the cloth to swell, and to
fill all interstices.</p>

<p>When you have proved the above-mentioned instrument,
prior to your using it, make sure that the lamp does not
smoke, but that it gives a vivid light; that the concave
mirror is very bright; that the magnifying-glass is dry and
clean. (You dry these with a piece of soft leather and
some whitening, so fine as not to scratch. The painted
glasses are cleaned with a piece of very fine cloth, made
quite hot, or of cambric, taking care not to rub off the
painting.) You then place the wooden ruler with the
reversed figure in the slide, opened purposely to receive
it, in the first cylinder; then, the figures being reflected
on a whitewashed wall, you regulate the distance of
the magnifying-glasses, in order to have the paintings
seen in all their perfection at a regular fixed distance.
Your instrument is then ready for the exhibition.</p>

<p>To this effect, you present yourself facing the framed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
linen, with the phantascope suspended before you, and
held by two braces across your shoulders. In order
that the figures may decrease in the eyes of the spectators
of the other side, you must advance slowly near the
cloth, drawing the two magnifying-glasses at a distance
from each other, but very gently, that the figures should
remain steady.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, you should wish them to appear
magnified, gradually draw back, with the same precaution,
and bring the glasses nearer each other; when
they are quite close, the figures seem to be coming towards
the spectators, and to proceed forward.</p>

<p>When you change the paintings, you must hide the
eye-glass behind an opaque and black body. The
knowledge of the management of the glasses, and the
accuracy of the proceeding backward and forward, upon
which depends entirely the good effect of the exhibition,
may be acquired by a few days’ practice previous to
the exhibition being made in company.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the box for the phantascope, if made
of wood, will be heavier than a tin one, yet it is to be
preferred, on account of its communicating much less
heat than the tin.</p>

<p>Such persons as wish to paint their figures should
use a varnish that does not spread on the glass; thick
copal varnish will answer the purpose.</p>

<h3 id="sec_88"><i>The Enchanted Mirrors.</i></h3>

<p>Make a box of wood, of a cubical figure, of about
fifteen inches every way. Let it be fixed on a pedestal,
at the usual height of a man’s head. In each side of
this box, let there be an opening of an oval form, ten
inches high, and seven wide.</p>

<p>In this box place two mirrors, with their backs
against each other; let them cross the box in a diagonal
line, and in a vertical position. Decorate the
openings in the sides of this box with four oval frames,
and transparent glasses, and cover each of them with a
curtain, so contrived that they may all draw up together.</p>

<p>Place four persons in front of the four sides, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
equal distances from the box, and then draw up the
curtains, that they may see themselves in the mirrors;
when each of them, instead of his own figure, will see
that of the person who is next him, and who, at the same
time, will seem to him to be placed on the opposite side.
Their confusion will be the greater, as it will be very
difficult for them to discover the mirror contained in the
box. The reason of this phenomenon is evident; for,
though the rays of light may be turned aside by a mirror,
yet they always appear to proceed in right lines.</p>

<h3 id="sec_89"><i>The Wonderful Phantoms.</i></h3>

<p>In a partition make two apertures of a foot high, and
ten inches wide, and about a foot distant from each other.
Let them be at the common height of a man’s head; and
in each of them place a transparent glass, surrounded
with a frame, like a common mirror.</p>

<p>Behind this partition place two mirrors, inclined to it
in an angle of forty-five degrees (that is, be halfway
between a line drawn perpendicular to the ground and
its surface); let them be both eighteen inches square;
let all the space between them be enclosed by boards,
or pasteboard, painted black, and well closed, that no
light may enter. Let there be also two curtains to
cover them, which may be drawn aside at pleasure.</p>

<p>When a person looks into one of these supposed mirrors,
instead of seeing his own face, he will perceive the
object that is in front of the other; so that, if two persons
present themselves at the same time before these
mirrors, instead of each one seeing himself, they will
reciprocally see each other.</p>

<p>Note.—There should be a sconce, with a candle
placed on each side of the two glasses in the wainscot,
to enlighten the faces of the persons who look in them;
otherwise this experiment will have no remarkable
effect.</p>

<p>This curious trick may be considerably improved, by
placing the two glasses in the partition in adjoining
rooms; and, a number of persons being previously placed
in one room, when a stranger enters the other, you may
tell him his face is dirty, and desire him to look in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
glass, which he will naturally do; and on seeing a strange
face he will draw back; but, returning to it, and seeing
another, and another, like the phantom kings in Macbeth,
what his surprise will be is more easy to conceive
than express. After this, a real mirror may be privately let
down on the back of the glass, and, if he can be prevailed
to look in once more, he will then, to his further
astonishment, see his own face, and may be told, perhaps
persuaded, that all he thought he saw before was
mere imagination.</p>

<p>How many tricks, less artful than this, have passed
in former times for sorcery, and pass at this time, in some
countries, for apparitions!</p>

<p>Note.—When a man looks in a mirror that is placed
perpendicular to another, his face will appear entirely
deformed. If the mirror be a little inclined, so as to
make an angle of eighty degrees (that is, one ninth part
from the perpendicular), he will then see all the parts of
his face, except the nose and forehead. If it be inclined
to sixty degrees (that is, one third part), he will appear
with three noses and six eyes: in short, the apparent
deformity will vary at each degree of inclination; and
when the glass comes to forty-five degrees (that is, half
way down), the face will vanish. If, instead of placing
the two mirrors in this situation, they are so disposed
that their junction may be vertical, their different inclinations
will produce other effects, as the situation of the
object relative to these mirrors is quite different.</p>

<h3 id="sec_90"><i>The Real Apparition.</i></h3>

<p>Behind a partition place, in a position somewhat oblique,
a concave mirror, which must be at least ten inches
in diameter, and its distance from the partition equal to
three fourths of the distance of its centre.</p>

<p>In the partition, make an opening of seven or eight
inches, either square or circular: it must face the mirror,
and be of the same height with it. Behind this partition
place a strong light, so disposed, that it may not be seen
at the opening, and may illumine an object placed near
it, without throwing any light on the mirror.</p>

<p>Beneath the aperture in the partition, place an object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
that you intend shall appear on the outside of the partition,
in an inverted position, and which we will suppose
to be a flower. Before the partition, and beneath
the aperture, place a little flower-pot, the top of which
should be even with the bottom of the aperture, that the
eye may see the flower in the same position as if its
stalks came out of the pot.</p>

<p>Take care to paint the space between the back part of
the partition and the mirror black, to prevent any reflections
of light from being thrown on the mirror; in a
word, so dispose the whole that it may be as little enlightened
as possible.</p>

<p>When a person is placed at the point of vision, he will
perceive the flower that is behind the partition, at the top
of the pot; but, on putting out his hand to pluck it, he
will find that he attempts to grasp a shadow.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger"><i>Observations.</i></p>

<p>The phenomena that may be produced by means of
concave mirrors are highly curious and astonishing. By
their aid spectres of various kinds may be exhibited.
Suppose, for example, you were to tell any one, that at
such an hour, and in such a place, he should see the apparition
of an absent or deceased friend (of whose portrait
you are in possession); in order to produce this
phantom, instead of the hole in the partition, there must
be a door which opens into an apartment to which there
is a considerable descent. Under that door you are to
place the portrait, which must be inverted and strongly
illuminated, that it may be properly reflected by the mirror,
which must be large and well polished. Then,
having introduced the spectator at another door, and
placed him in the proper point of view, you suddenly
throw open the first door, when, to his great astonishment,
he will immediately see the apparition of his
friend.</p>

<p>It will be objected, perhaps, that this is not a perfect
apparition, because it is only visible at one point of
view, and by one person. But it should be remembered,
that it was an established maxim in the last century,
that a spectre might be visible to one person, and not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
others. So Shakespeare makes both Hamlet and Macbeth
see apparitions that were not visible to others,
present at the same time. It is not unlikely, moreover,
that this maxim took its rise from certain apparitions of
the kind, <em>that were raised by the monks, to serve some
purposes they called religious</em>; as they alone were in
possession of what little learning there then was in the
world.</p>

<h3 id="sec_91"><i>To draw a Deformed Figure, which will appear well
proportioned from a certain Point of View.</i></h3>

<p>Draw any thing you may fancy on a thin white pasteboard;
then prick it; afterwards put the same on an
horizontal surface, which we will suppose to be another
pasteboard; put a lighted candle behind that drawing,
and draw on the horizontal surface the lines given by the
light; this will give a deformed design. This being
done, take away the drawing that was pricked, and the
candle; then place your eye where the light was, and
you will see your drawing assume a regular form.</p>

<h2 id="chap_9">CHEMICAL CHANGES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_92"><i>To change the Colour of a Rose.</i></h3>

<p>Burn some sulphur under the rose, by holding underneath
it a lighted bundle of matches. This will fade the
red colour, and make the flower turn white or blanched.
Its primitive colour will return in about a couple of
hours.</p>

<h3 id="sec_93"><i>To turn Water into Wine.</i></h3>

<p>Take four glasses; rub one in the inside with a piece
of moist alum: let the second have a drop of vinegar in
it; the third empty. Let the fourth be filled with clean
water; in your mouth put a clean rag, with ground
basil tied close in it, the bulk not to be bigger than a
small nut, which must lie between your hind teeth and
your cheek; then take some of the water that is in the
glass into your mouth, and return it into the glass that
hath the drop of vinegar in it, which will cause it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
turn the perfect colour of sack wine; then turn it in your
mouth again, and chew the rag of basil between your
teeth, and squirt the liquor into the glass, and it will
have the perfect colour of claret; returning the basil
into its former place, take the liquor into your mouth
again, and presently squirt it into the glass you rubbed
with alum, and it will have the perfect colour of mulberry
wine.</p>

<h3 id="sec_94"><i>Arbor Dianæ; or, the Silver Tree.</i></h3>

<p>This name has been given to a beautiful and curious
precipitation of silver, by means of mercury in an arborescent
form. The experiment is made by putting a soft
amalgam of silver into six parts of a solution of nitrate
of silver, and four of a solution of nitrate of mercury, <span class="locked">or—</span></p>

<p>Amalgamate in a glass mortar one quarter of an ounce
of pure mercury and half an ounce of fine silver. Insert
in this amalgamation four ounces of pure nitric acid for the
solution, and increase the whole by a pint of distilled
water; mix it well, and keep it in a glass decanter well
stopped. By introducing into this liquid a lump of soft
amalgam of silver, the formation of the tree speedily
takes place.</p>

<p>Or, if you wish to make the experiment on a smaller
scale, pour about an ounce of the above liquid into a
wine-glass, into which insert a piece of soft amalgam of
silver, the size of a pea, and the effect required will
immediately be produced. The silver, separating in
the form of prismatic needles, will arrange itself so as
to assume an arborescent appearance.</p>

<h3 id="sec_95"><i>The Lead Tree.</i></h3>

<p>The precipitation of a solution of acetate of lead by
means of a piece of zinc, so as to form what is commonly
called the lead tree, is perfectly analogous to this
theory, but is too well known to require illustration.</p>

<h3 id="sec_96"><i>The Tree of Mars.</i></h3>

<p>Dissolve iron filings in aqua fortis moderately concentrated,
till the acid is saturated; then pour gradually
into the solution a solution of fixed alkali, commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
called oil of tartar. A strong effervescence will take
place, and the iron, instead of falling to the bottom of
the vessel, will afterwards rise, so as to cover its sides,
forming a multitude of ramifications heaped one upon
the other, which will sometimes pass over the edge of
the vessel, and extend themselves on the outside, with
all the appearance of a plant. If any of the liquor is
spilt, it must be carefully collected, and be again put
into the vessel, where it will form new ramifications,
which will contribute to increase the mass of the vegetation.</p>

<h3 id="sec_97"><i>To form a Metallic Tree, in the Shape of a Fir.</i></h3>

<p>In a small globular bottle with a tall neck, dissolve
one ounce of fine silver in three ounces of nitric acid;
put the bottle into a sand bath, and let it remain over a
slow fire till the liquid be half reduced; then add three
ounces of good white-wine vinegar, a little warmed;
shake the mixture, and place the bottle in any place
where it is not likely to be disturbed: in about a month’s
time a beautiful metallic fir will appear, ramifying to the
very surface of the liquid.</p>

<h3 id="sec_98"><i>To make a Gold or Silver Tree, to serve as a
Chimney Ornament.</i></h3>

<p>Make an amalgam of a small portion of fine gold, and
ten times the quantity of purified cinnabar.</p>

<p>Grind and wash the amalgam in water, till no black
colour appears: when perfectly clean, dry the amalgam,
and insert it into a glass retort; place it in a sand bath
over a slow fire, which must be preserved ignited for a
day or two; gradually increase the heat, to expel the
mercury from the gold, whose metallic vegetation will
be perfectly in proportion to the mercury which escapes.
When the fire is extinguished you will find the mercury
expelled into the receiver, and the gold remaining in
the retort will be soft and malleable, possessing the
purest appearance; the mass will have sprouted
branches, in perfect imitation of small shrubs and trees
of different forms and height, which may be separated
from the heap, serving as their base, when taken from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
the retort. These will allow even of being made red
hot without injury to their appearance, or fear of decomposition,
and may be used as ornaments for any length
of time.</p>

<p>For the silver, use the same proportion of metal as for
the gold tree.</p>

<h3 id="sec_99"><i>Sympathetic or Secret Inks.</i></h3>

<p>Sympathetic or secret inks are those fluids which,
when written with on paper, are invisible when dry, but
acquire colour by heating the paper, or by applying to
the invisible writing another chymical agent. These phenomena
arrested particularly the attention of the old
chymists, and accordingly, in their fanciful way, they
called them <em>sympathetic inks</em>.</p>

<p>The writing made with this ink may, therefore, at pleasure
be made to become visible or invisible successively,
by alternately warming and cooling, if care be taken not
to expose the paper to a greater degree of heat than is necessary
to make the invisible writing legible.</p>

<h3 id="sec_100"><i>Preparation of Green Sympathetic Ink.</i></h3>

<p>Put into a mattrass one part of cobalt or zaffree, and
four ounces of nitro-muriatic acid. Digest the mixture
with a gentle heat until the acid dissolves no more; then
add muriatic of soda, equal in quantity to the cobalt
employed, and four times as much water as acid, and
filter the liquor through paper.</p>

<h3 id="sec_101"><i>Blue Sympathetic Ink.</i></h3>

<p>This ink, which may be used like the preceding, is
prepared in the following manner. Take one ounce of
cobalt reduced to powder, put it into a Florence flask,
and pour over it two ounces of pure nitric acid. Expose
the mixture to a gentle heat, and, when the cobalt is dissolved,
add, by small quantities, a solution of potash,
until no more precipitate ensues. Let these precipitates
subside: decant the super-natant fluid, and wash the
residuum repeatedly in distilled water, until it passes
tasteless; then dissolve it in a sufficient quantity of distilled
vinegar, by the assistance of a gentle heat, taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
care to have a saturated solution, which will be known
by part of the precipitate remaining undissolved after
the vinegar has been digested on it for some time.</p>

<h3 id="sec_102"><i>Yellow Sympathetic Ink.</i></h3>

<p>Neutralize muriatic acid with brown oxide of copper:
the solution is of a dark olive-green colour, and by
evaporation yields crystals of a grass-green colour of
muriate of copper, which, when dissolved in ten parts of
water, forms this ink, and may be employed as before
stated.</p>

<h3 id="sec_103"><i>Purple Sympathetic Ink.</i></h3>

<p>Dissolve cobalt or zaffre in nitric acid, add salt of
tartar gradually and in small quantities to avoid too
powerful an effervescence, let the precipitate subside,
and, having drawn off the super-natant clear liquid, add
a sufficient quantity of water, when the ink will be fit
for use.</p>

<h3 id="sec_104"><i>Rose-coloured Sympathetic Ink.</i></h3>

<p>Dissolve zaffre in nitric acid, to which add saltpetre
well purified, and you will possess a rose-coloured ink,
having the same properties as the preceding.</p>

<h3 id="sec_105"><i>Application of the Secret Inks.</i></h3>

<p>Write any unimportant matter with common ink, and
let the lines be tolerably wide apart; then between
these lines write the communication you wish to make
with any of the above invisible inks. Your correspondent,
by holding the paper before the fire, will be
speedily enabled to peruse the letter; the characters
will again become invisible when the paper has cooled.
The writing in common ink will serve to lull the suspicions
of those who might intercept the letter.</p>

<p>With this kind of ink, some very ingenious and
amusing tricks may be performed.</p>

<h3 id="sec_106"><i>A Drawing which alternately represents Winter and
Summer Scenes.</i></h3>

<p>Draw a landscape, and delineate the ground, the
trunks, and branches of the trees, with the usual water-colours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
employed for that purpose, tracing the grass and
trees with sympathetic ink. By these means you will have
a drawing, which, at the common temperature of the atmosphere,
will represent a winter piece; but if it be exposed
to a proper degree of heat, not too strong, you will see
the ground covered with verdure, and the trees suddenly
wrapped with a beautiful foliage; replace the picture in
the cool, and the dreary aspect of winter re-appears.
The colours must be lighter for the back grounds.</p>

<p>Screens painted in this manner were formerly made at
Paris. Those to whom they were presented, if unacquainted
with the artifice, were astonished to find, when
they made use of them, that the views they exhibited
were totally changed. Persons not understanding
drawing may amuse themselves in this manner, by
colouring an outlined engraving representing winter,
following exactly the process enjoined for the above.</p>

<h3 id="sec_107"><i>Demonstration of the various Strata of Earth which
cover the Globe.</i></h3>

<p>In a middling-sized glass bottle, three parts full of
clear water, infuse pure alumine precipitated by ammonia,
till the bottle is nearly filled.—Expose the bottle
to the cold air in frosty weather; or, at other times, to
artificial frost. At the moment when the frigorific effect
ensues, the alumine will divide all over the surface of
the water, and form itself into separate and very regular
strata.</p>

<h3 id="sec_108"><i>To freeze Water in the Midst of Summer, without
the Application of Ice.</i></h3>

<p>Take eleven drachms of muriate of ammonia, ten of
nitrate of potash, and sixteen of sulphate of soda;
reduce each of these salts separately to a fine powder,
and mix them gradually in a glass, or rather in a thin
metal vessel, with five ounces of water (the capacity of
the vessel should be only just large enough to hold the
materials): the result will be, that, as the salts dissolve,
cold will be produced, and a thermometer immersed in
the mixture will sink at or below freezing. A little
water, about half an ounce, in a test tube, when immersed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
in the mixture during its solution, becomes frozen
in about ten minutes.</p>

<p>The salts employed in this experiment may be recovered
from the solution, if the sulphate of soda be
omitted, by evaporating the water, to serve again any
number of times. Five parts of muriate of ammonia, five
of nitre, and eight of sulphate of soda, mixed with sixteen
of water, at the usual temperature, sink the thermometer
from 50 to about 10 degrees.</p>

<p>The salts, to produce their fullest frigorific effect,
should be recently crystallized in fine powder, and contain
as much water of crystallization as possible, but
they should not be damp.</p>

<p>If to three parts of ice thus procured, you add four
parts of potash, the thermometer will sink from 32° to 61°
below Zero, or the freezing point; giving 93 degrees of
cold. Snow or common ice, mixed with potash in the
same proportions, would serve equally well; but the
above experiments are given under the supposition that
they are difficult to be procured.</p>

<h2 id="chap_10">MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS AND
EXPERIMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_109"><i>To swallow a long Pudding made of Tin.</i></h3>

<p>This pudding must be made of tin, consisting of twelve
or thirteen little hoops, round, and in little ringlets, so
that they may seem to fall one through another. It
must have little holes made at the biggest end, that
it may not hurt your mouth: hold this pudding, for so it
is called, privately in your left hand, with the hole end
uppermost, and with your right hand take a ball out
of your pocket, and say, “<i>If there is any old woman that
is out of conceit with herself, because her neighbours deem
her not so young as she would be thought, let her come
to me, for this ball is a present remedy</i>;” then seem to
put the ball into your left hand, but let it slip into your
lap, and clap the pudding into your mouth, which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
be thought to be the ball that you showed them; then
decline your head, and open your mouth, and the pudding
will slip down at its full length, which, with your
right hand, you may strike into your mouth again;
doing this three or four times: then you may discharge
it into your hand, and clap it into your pocket without
any suspicion, by making three or four wry faces after
it, as though it had stuck in your throat; and if you
practise smiting easily on your throat, with your fist on
each side, the pudding will seem to chink as if it was
laying there; then say, “<i>Thus they eat puddings in
High Germany; they fling them down their throats before

then hang this artificial spider by a bit of gray sewing
silk (that is not twisted), between two bodies, the one
electrified, and the other not; or between two bodies
endowed with different electricities: it will go and come
between these two bodies, and the movement of the legs
will be seen as plainly as if it were a living spider.</p>

<h3 id="sec_111"><i>To pass a Ring through your Cheek.</i></h3>

<p>You must have two rings made of silver or brass, or
what you please, of one size, colour, and likeness,
saving that one must have a notch through it, and the
other must be whole, without a notch; show the whole
ring, but conceal that which hath the notch, and say,
“<i>Now I’ll put this ring through my cheek</i>,” and privately
slip the notch over one side of your mouth; then take a
small stick, which you must have in readiness, and slip
the whole ring upon it, holding your hand over it about
the middle of the stick; then bid somebody hold fast
the stick at both ends, and say, “<i>See this ring in my
cheek,—it turns round</i>;” then, while you perceive them
fasten their eyes upon that ring, on a sudden, whip it
out, and smite upon the stick therewith; instantly concealing
and whirling the other ring you hold your hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
over, round about the stick. It will be thought that
you have brought that ring upon the stick which was
upon your cheek.</p>

<h3 id="sec_112"><i>To cut a Hole in a Cloak, Scarf, or Handkerchief,
and by Words to make it whole again.</i></h3>

<p>To do this, you must have a piece of the same ready
in your hand, the sample of that you intend to cut; then,
amongst other tricks, clap your hand upon the place you
intend to cut. Now drawing the false piece through,
cause it to be cut off, and, griping your hand, show the
hole from whence the piece came away which is in your
hand. This is done by pretending to feel in your pocket
for a needle and thread to sew it up again. But, drawing
your hand out of your pocket, say “<i>I have no needle,
but I have a charm that will do as well</i>;” so, muttering
some words, bid them blow upon it, and, pulling your
hand from the place, show it entire.</p>

<h3 id="sec_113"><i>The Dancing Egg.</i></h3>

<p>Three eggs are brought out; two of them are put on a
table, and the third in a hat; a little cane is borrowed
from one of the company, and it is shown about, to convince
the spectators there is no preparation. It is then
placed across the hat; the hat falls to the ground, and
the egg sticks to it as if glued; the orchestra then plays
a piece of music, and the egg, as if it was sensible of the
harmony, twists about the cane from one end to the
other, and continues its motions till the music stops.</p>

<p><i>Explanation.</i>—The egg is fastened to a thread by a
pin, which is put in lengthways; and the hole, which
has been made to introduce this pin, is stopped with
white wax. The other end of the thread is fastened to
the breast of the person who performs this trick, with a
pin bent like a hook; the cane, passing under the
thread, near to the egg, serves for it to rest on. When
the music begins, the performer pushes the cane from
left to right, or from right to left; it then appears as if
the egg ran along the cane, which it does not, being
fastened to its thread; its centre of gravity remains
always at the same distance from the hook that holds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
it; it is the cane which, sliding along, presents its different
points to the surface of the egg.</p>

<p>N. B. To produce the illusion, and persuade the
company that it is the egg which carries itself to the
different points of the cane, the performer turns a little
on his heel; by this means the egg receives a motion,
which surprises the spectators, it remaining always at
the same distance from the point to which it was
fastened.</p>

<h3 id="sec_114"><i>To make Three Figures dance in a Glass.</i></h3>

<p>Take little hollow figures of glass about an inch and
a half high, representing little children, or grown-up
persons. These may be had of the glass-blowers; and,
as they contain a body of air, are lighter than water.
Immerse them in water contained in a glass of the
following <span class="locked">shape:—</span></p>

<div id="ip_76" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 13.375em;">
  <img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="214" height="436" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p class="in0">This glass is about a foot or fifteen
inches high, and covered with a bladder, which is tied
fast over the top; a small quantity of air is to be left
between the bladder and surface of the water; so, when
you command them to walk down, press your hand
hard upon the top, and they will immediately go down.
Thus you may make them dance in the middle of the glass,
at your pleasure; and, when you would have them go up
to the top, take your hand away, when they will go up.</p>

<h3 id="sec_115"><i>To shoot a Swallow, and to bring him to Life again.</i></h3>

<p>Load your gun with the usual charge of powder, but,
instead of shot, put in half a charge of quicksilver: prime
and shoot. If your piece bears ever so far from the bird,
the swallow will find itself stunned to such a degree, as
to fall to the ground in a fit. As it will regain its senses
in a few minutes, you may make use of the time, by
saying that you are going to bring it to life again. This
will greatly astonish the company. The ladies will, no
doubt, interest themselves in favour of the bird, and intercede
for its liberty;—sympathizing with their feelings
for the little prisoner may be the means of some of them
sympathizing with yours.</p>

<h3 id="sec_116"><i>Singular Trick with a Fowl.</i></h3>

<p>Take a cock from roost at night, or off its walk by
day, and bring him into a room full of company; keep
both your hands close to his wings; hold them tight:
put him on a table, and point his beak down as straight
as possible; and then let any one draw a line with a
piece of chalk, directly from his beak, and all the noise
you can possibly make, with drums, trumpets, or even
crowing of other cocks, will not disturb him from the
seeming lethargy, which that position you have laid him
in, with the chalked line, has effected. Strange as this
seems, yet the certainty of it is past a doubt, as many
gentlemen who have, ere this, sported some hundreds
on the turf, are ready to assert its truth.</p>

<h3 id="sec_117"><i>To put a Lock upon a Man’s Mouth.</i></h3>

<p>You must have a lock made for this purpose, according
to the figure; one side of its bow must be immoveable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
as that marked A; the other side is noted B, and
must be pinned to the body of the lock, as appears at E.</p>

<div id="ip_78" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="376" height="444" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">It must be so pinned that it may play to and fro with
ease; this side of the bow must have a leg as at B, and
then turn it into the lock; this leg must have two
notches filed on the inner side, which must be so managed
that one may lock or hold the two sides of the bow as
close together as possible, and the other notch to hold
the said part of the bow a proportionable distance
asunder: so that, being locked upon the cheek, it may
neither pinch too hard, nor yet hold it so slight that it
may be drawn off. Let there be a key fixed to it to
unlock it, as you see at D; and, lastly, let the bow have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
divers notches filed in it, so that the place of the partition,
when the lock is shut home, will the least of all
be suspected in the use of the lock. You must now
get one to hold a sixpence, edgeways, between his
teeth; then take another sixpence, and with your left
hand proffer to set it edgeways between a second man’s
teeth, pretending that your intent is to turn both into
which of their mouths they shall desire, by virtue of your
words; which he shall no sooner consent to do, but you,
by holding the lock privately in your right hand, with
your fore-finger a little down, after certain words, and
the lock having hung on a while, may seem to pull the
key out of his nose.</p>

<h3 id="sec_118"><i>To thrust a Bodkin into the Forehead, without Hurt.</i></h3>

<p>Take a hollow bodkin, so that the blade may slip
therein as soon as the point is held upwards. Seem to
thrust it into your forehead, and, with a little sponge in
your hand, bring out blood or wine, making the spectators
think that the blood or wine (whereof you may
say you have drank very much) runs out of your forehead;
then, after showing some appearance of pain,
pull away your hand suddenly, holding the point downwards,
and it will fall out, and seem never to have
been thrust into the haft; but, immediately afterwards,
throw that bodkin into your lap or pocket, and pull out
another plain one like it, which will completely deceive
the spectators.</p>

<h3 id="sec_119"><i>To thrust a Bodkin through your Tongue.</i></h3>

<p>This trick is to be performed in much the same manner
as the former, and, as in the first case, without hurt; if
the reader will take the pains to practise this trick, he
will be in no more danger of performing one than the
other.</p>

<p>To render the deception as complete as possible, proceed
as follows:—Make a bodkin, or nail, the blade
thereof being cut in the middle, so that one part may
not be close to the other, by almost three quarters of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
inch, each part being kept asunder by a small crooked
piece of iron, of the fashion described in the next trick;
then thrust your tongue between the aforesaid place,
to wit, into the space left in the bodkin-blade, thrusting
the said part behind your teeth, and biting it. It will
seem to stick so fast in, and through your tongue, that
one can hardly pull it out. You must have another
bodkin or nail, just like the false one, to show the
company.</p>

<h3 id="sec_120"><i>To appear to cut your Arm off, without Hurt or
Danger.</i></h3>

<p>You must provide yourself with two knives, a true
one and a false one, and let them be so like each other,
that no person can tell one from the other. When
you go to show this feat to the company, put the true
knife into your pocket; then take out the false one, and
clap it on your wrist undiscovered. If, with a sponge,
you make the knife bloody, it will seem so much the
more strange. This is the form of the <span class="locked">knife:—</span></p>

<div id="ip_80" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_086.jpg" width="352" height="126" alt="" /></div>

<h3 id="sec_121"><i>Tricks with a Cat.</i></h3>

<p>Fix a little bell to the end of a cat’s tail, and let her
go; she, feeling the tightness of the string, and hearing
the bell jingle, will run up and down as if she were
mad, flying against the doors and windows; then, if she
can, she will get into some hole to hide herself; but,
when she wags her tail ever so little, out she comes,
and will be as mad as before, and will never rest till it
be off. Walnut shells, fastened with a little warm wax
or pitch to the cat’s feet, will make sport all over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
house; and at night, on the stairs, will make the
superstitious think that it is a ghost going up and
down.</p>

<h3 id="sec_122"><i>To make a Calf’s Head bellow, when served up to
Table.</i></h3>

<p>This is effected by the following simple stratagem:—Take
a frog that is alive, and put it at the further end of
the calf’s head, under the tongue, which you must let
fall all over it, taking care not to put the frog there till
the calf’s head is going to be served up. The heat of
the tongue will make the frog croak; which sound,
coming from the hollow part of the head, will be like
the bellowing of a calf, as if it were alive.</p>

<h3 id="sec_123"><i>To make a Ball rise above the Water.</i></h3>

<p>Place on the spout of the fountain an inverted cone
of wire net-work; throw into it a light hollow copper
ball, two inches and a half in diameter, which let fall
to the narrow part of the cone to reach the spout: it will
rise, and remain suspended in the air till brought down
by the wind, and repeatedly re-ascend.</p>

<h3 id="sec_124"><i>Mode of sealing Letters, whereby an impression cannot
be taken.</i></h3>

<p>Take a piece of any aromatic resin, or of amber, and
set fire to it on an earthen plate. It will emit a smoke
of an agreeable smell: hold your watch-seal over the
fumigation; it will become black: then melt some sealing-wax,
in the usual way, spread it on paper, and apply
to it the seal, prepared as above; and, when you
take it off, the engraving will be seen very plainly.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the impression from being taken,
flatten the sealing-wax with the blade of a knife: this
is easily done, by means of making a thick iron plate
red hot, and bringing it close to the impression without
touching it; the wax then gets soft, but, before it melts,
you must flatten it with a knife, or any other cold instrument.
Although thus flattened, the exact impression
will remain conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_125"><i>The Enchanted Egg.</i></h3>

<p>Have ready a penny-worth of quicksilver in a quill,
sealed at both ends with good hard wax; then cause an
egg to be boiled, and take off a small bit of the shell of
the narrow end, and thrust in your quill of quicksilver,
and lay the egg on the ground; you will have sport
enough; for it will keep tumbling about as long as there
is any heat in it.</p>

<h3 id="sec_126"><i>To cut a Man’s Head off, and to put it into a Platter,
a Yard from the Body.</i></h3>

<p>This is a noble trick, if it be performed by a skilful
hand. To show it to advantage, you must cause a board,
a cloth, and a platter to be purposely made, and in each of
them to be made holes, for a man’s neck.</p>

<div id="ip_82" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.625em;">
  <img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="378" height="375" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
The board must
be made of two planks, the longer and broader the
better; there must be left, within half a yard of the
end of each plank, half a hole, so as, both the planks
being thrust together, there may remain two holes, like
to the holes in a pair of stocks. There must be made
likewise a hole in the cloth; a platter, also, must be set
directly over or upon one of them, having a hole in the
middle thereof, of the like size, and also a piece cut
off the same as big as the neck, through which the head
may be conveyed into the middle of the platter; and
then, sitting or kneeling under the board, let the head
only remain upon the board, in the frame. Then, to make
the sight more dreadful, put a saucer, containing saffron,
common salt, and spirits of wine, burning, before the
head of the boy, who must gasp two or three times. The
head will presently appear quite dead, if the boy set
his countenance accordingly; and, if a little blood be
sprinkled on his face, the sight will be the stranger
and more horrible still.</p>

<p>This is practised with a boy instructed for the purpose,
who, being familiar with the company, may be known as
well by his face as by his apparel. At the other end of
the table, where the like hole is made, another boy, of
the same size, must be placed, having on his usual apparel;
he must lean or lie upon the board, and put his
head underneath it, through the said hole; so that the
body shall seem to lie on one end of the board, and his
head shall lie in a platter on the other end. There are
other rules to be observed; as, to put about his neck a
little dough, kneaded with bullock’s blood, which, being
cold, will look like dead flesh, and, being pricked with
a sharp quill, filled with blood, will seem to bleed.—You
must be particular to have the table-cloth so long
and so wide as that it may almost reach the ground.
Also, let this be your last trick, taking care not to suffer
the company to stay too long in the place after it is performed.</p>

<h3 id="sec_127"><i>To cause Beer to be wrung out of the Handle of a
Knife.</i></h3>

<p>To do this, you must have a small piece of sponge,
with liquor put in it privately; then, unseen, place this
beyond your right ear; but let not the sponge be too big,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
or too full of liquor, lest you be discovered. Now,
taking a knife, stick it, with the handle upwards, in a
table or stool (but observe to place your company before
you); then bid them look, saying, “<i>There you see
is nothing of wet, either on this handle or the table</i>;” so
stretch your empty hand towards your ear, darting the
point, saying, “<i>Now, somebody cross my arm</i>,” and, speaking
some powerful words, as “<i>Jubio bisco</i>,” then you
have a fair opportunity to take the sponge into your hand
from behind your ear; stretching forth your hand,
squeeze it gently, and afterwards a little harder, which
will make it run the faster, to the amazement of the
company, at the same time saying, “<i>Thus could I do
till I had drowned you all.</i>” Then sprinkle a little in
their faces, which will cause them to shut their eyes,
whilst you convey away the sponge.</p>

<h3 id="sec_128"><i>To cut a Glass by Heat.</i></h3>

<p>You must have a piece of well-dried match-cord.
Having lighted it by the candle, take a beer-glass, and
hold the match to the edge of the glass; now have your
finger ready wetted, and, when the glass is very hot,
clap your finger to the hot place, and it will suddenly
crack about a quarter of an inch downward; then keep
the coal of the match at the like distance from the end of
the crack; and, as it follows, so move your hand, and
cut it screw-fashion, otherwise it will not hold together
till you have it through to the bottom. When you have
done it, and it is cold, take it by the foot, and turn it
downwards: it will stretch so that you may put your
finger between each cutting; then, when you turn it up
again, you may drink a glass of beer from it, and not
spill a drop.</p>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
